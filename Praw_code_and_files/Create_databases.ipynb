Waiting for a response before I delete the account completely. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nGood Morning, \\n\\nI was just curious as to what happened to blizzard? How much money would we need to raise to get you off of China's funds? Banning a esports player for supporting Hong Kong is by far the most disgusting action this company has done and you guys partnered with Activision!! As a company you make a weak claim that you are protecting your image by attempting to silence this person, however in doing so you have proven your real opinion. Blizzard cares more about profit then about the freedom the people there are fighting for. Shame on this company. I know it's not much for one person to stop playing anything related to blizzard but I'll be doing so and encouraging my friends to do the same. Perhaps you have missed the video's of emergency services in tears because they are being physically blocked from assisting protesters, or the video of children as young as 10 being arrested. How about the videos of peaceful protesters being shot in the face with bags and losing their eyes? How much is their eye worth blizzard?  Maybe you've missed the news where they've banned masks in an attempt to arrest more people. Maybe you've missed the recent news that protesters have been shot with real ammunition now versus the bags. I'm glad you are in America where you can openly run your business with no issues of the government ever limiting your freedoms. I hope your office is nice and cozy while these people fight for their freedom. You've made your opinion clear blizzard. Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time.\",\n",

They can sit in their offices, watch South Park, drink coffee, say whatever they like, do whatever they like, without fear of persecution.\\n\\nAnd they do this to a Hong Kong player, because of money. \\n\\nAre they not rich enough? Are they so scared of their board members? Are they so scared of their investors?\\n\\nI am not a Blizzard fan, and I certainly will never be a Blizzard fan.\\n\\nPS: yes, I deliberately mentioned South Park.\\n\\nEdit: persecution, not prosecution!',\n",

HOWEVER! STANDARD TERMS OF SERVICE FOR ANY GAME AND HOST WILL OUTLINE THAT RADICAL VIEWS ARE AGAINST THE RULES!\\n\\nYou can express an opinion, but crossing the line and expressing his views the way he did is nothing short of an active attempt to promote propaganda, something no company would allow on a large or small scale behaviour, because it triggers conflict amongst the player base and a sort of drama that not everyone wishes to see.\\n\\nIf you do not agree to the terms of services, then do not sign and tick that box when registering for games. The moment you do, you are in a binding agreement with said company.\\n\\nBlizzard enforced their own rules, there was nothing Blizzard has done wrong, the player was at fault for ignoring the basic terms of conditions and going out of his way to do what he did. It was an unprofessional behaviour.\\n\\nSame with the NBA's situation, whilst they supported the managers opinion as his own, nor have they denied it to be wrong, that moment of unprofessionalism has cost the NBA their relationship with China.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, these companies, businesses and other nations arent going to interfere, dictate how China and Hong Kong should resolve the conflict.\\n\\nAlso, no one wants to be the trigger of World War 3, if things escalates any further, blood shall be spilled not to mention it is getting eerie that the events are get closer and closer to prophecies by Nostradamus and the Tui Bei Tu (I'm not superstitious, but I find it interesting that prophecies suggest the world war will be between NATO and China, bearing in mind 55 out of 60 Tui Bei Tu prophecy has been fulfilled)\",\n",

       " u'As much as I respect the fight for democracy and support all the protests, I do think Blizzard made the right call. If he can say political stuff and get away with it, what would stop a communist or a nazi saying their beliefs?  It would just open a floodgate, everyone knowing they can say political stuff and not get in trouble. That being said it\\u2019s very unfortunate and I hope he doesn\\u2019t take it too hard. He\\u2019s very brave and I support what he did 100%',\n",
       " u\"Unfortunately, most people won't boycott.\\nWe live in a culture where people have a fear of missing out, so they keep supporting companies like Blizzard, EA and Epic.\\n\\nWe need to be relentless in our shaming and ridicule of these people. Not just online, but also in person.\\nHarass them incessantly. Make it hard to continue their support of big business.\",\n",

       " u\"Unpopular opinion. This is a shitty thing to do on Blizzard's part, but China needs to be blamed a little here. They seem to be threatening to remove Blizzard games from China completely if they don't comply, and that could be a huge hit on the company as a whole.\",\n",
       " u\"Im gonna play devil's advocate and say that theres not much they can do, china would clearly retaliate if blizz didn't do as they did, like what happened with NBA getting pulled off TV in China because of adam silver's response to the Houston Rockets issue\",\n",

       " u\"According to the linked article it's written down in the rules and I don't get why everybody here is going batshit crazy about this ban. I don't play HS nor do I watch the tournaments and the last time I played D3 (my last blizz game) is +3 years ago, so call me weird but this ban isn't even remotely connected to human rights or profit, it's simply the execution of a rule. \\n\\nIf it'd be some dude boasting about *how good alt-right ideology is* you'd be on the side of Blizzard wouldn't you?\",\n",

       " u'Its not profit over human rights. The guy violated his contract and he now has to face the penalty. This is fucking stupid. This hate mongering in our current society is rediculous. While they are handling the situation poorly from an outsiders point of view, we dont know the full story.',\n",

I have a lot of respect for the developers and all the creators of the games--they inspire me to be stronger and better. When I played by shaman and death knight in WoW--Blizzard enabled me to be a hero. When I played Overwatch, Blizzard gave me the ability to be strong, even if in the game ""I"" was an unsanctioned vigilante. Maybe the people behind the Overwatch 2 cinematic were trying to tell us to fight. Maybe the the Diablo 4 and Shadowlands cinematics were telling us that we had a challenging conflict ahead of us. But I can't play those games. It's time to show Blizzard what we can do to support the heroes that are fighting for their rights, because they are fighting a battle that we might have to fight.

You really want to help them? Find the organizations that *are* actively supporting them, be it via monetary funding or sending physical goods their way.

After this China fiasco and watching the South Park episode I've thought long and hard about the situation and I've concluded I no longer wish to be an Activision/Blizzard customer. I have cancelled my WoW subscription:

    Your World of Warcraft® account and characters have not been deleted. 
    In the event that you return to the game, you can resume playing right where you left off.
    
    Your subscription will be valid until Oct 16, 2019 9:22 PM. In order to return to the game, 
    you can start a new subscription or use a game time card.

Deleted all Blizzard / Activision games off of my computer and uninstalled Battle.net. I have combed my steam library and have uninstalled all Activision published games I had installed:

    Call of Duty: Black Ops III
    Prototype
    Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved

I don't think I will ever touch a Blizzard or Activision game again in my life after this. Been playing Blizzard games since Brood War in the 90's. The cat and mouse custom game was the first PC gaming experience I remember having. Writing this hurts deeply but I know I'm making the right decision. Supporting communist China is not something I wish to be complicit with and continuing to play Blizzard/Activision games now leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I cannot think of anything the company can say or do to remedy this situation as they've just spit in HK's and everyone who supports democracy's face. There is no apology that I will accept. Signing off Battle.net for good, FUCK CHINA, FREE HONG KONG, peace out.

Edit: Also doing some research on other US companies Tencent has a stake in (Chinese company who apparently controls Blizzard/Activision now) I found:

    Snapchat
    Tesla Motors
    Glu Mobile

Guess my hopes of ever buying a Tesla are now out the door as long as they remain investors. Also deleting my Snapchat account too.

Edit2: Tencent has also invested 150+ million into Reddit. Fuck. Well I guess I'll keep my account here so I can continue to say FUCK CHINA! Xi Jinping is a fat ass blood thirsty dictator that looks like Winnie-the-Pooh. Also:

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.",2019-10-09 07:30:26

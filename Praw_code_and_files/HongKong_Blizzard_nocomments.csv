BOYCOTT TIKTOK.",7650,dgdwgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgdwgn/honestly_forget_the_nba_forget_blizzard_forget/,268,"I'm not saying that the NBA, Apple, and Blizzard don't deserve everything that has been said about them. They 100% do. And I'm not saying you should actually ""forget"" them.

*but*

I propose that we take all this energy we're using to shame them and aim it towards **TikTok.**

And if you use it, uninstall it.

TikTok is owned by a massive Chinese conglomerate called ""ByteDance,"" and **they censor content *not just in China,* but in the US and Europe as well,** based on Chinese censorship guidelines:

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing

>The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app.

And **they are staunch supporters of the CCP and operate with the goal of advancing the CCP agenda** (if not just directly run by the CCP):

>CEO Zhang Yiming issued a letter in 2018 stating that his company would ""further deepen cooperation"" with Communist Party of China authorities to promote their policies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok#National_security_concerns_in_the_US

And, **they are actively censoring the Hong Kong protest, globally.** It's the only social media site in the west where searching for #HongKong returns *no results.*

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/

Reddit is here destroying US companies for making concessions to China, which is totally fair. But, at the same time, we're all posting TikToks all over reddit, and it's a top 5 app on both Google Play and the App Store. There's a TikTok subreddit (/r/TikTokCringe/) with almost 200,000 subscribers.

I worry that we have forgotten who we're really trying to punish, here. Did Apple and Blizzard and the NBA fuck up? Yes. Do they deserve the heat? Yes. But damaging US companies to punish the CCP is a small hit. At worst, it actually *helps* the chinese economy if we boycott US companies.

Going after TikTok, who is deeply-entangled with the Chinese government (and lets be honest, probably just *is* the Chinese government) and is directly implementing China-style censorship around the globe is a much better move, IMO.

#BOYCOTT TIKTOK

EDIT: A lot of people are mentioning how they already don't use TikTok. I've never used it either. I suppose a better message than ""Boycott TikTok"" would be ""spread awareness of TikTok's global censorship and CCP agenda.""

Along with multiple senators bashing on the companies.   This will help set the precedent that support for China's tyranny is not and will not be tolerated.

Combine that with the new awakening and realization that China has more influence than we thought. And that there are indeed companies that OPENLY support this for nothing more than earning a buck.  Has brought a revitalization in attention to the protests.  Not only on an international level, but (hopefully) especially in the U.S.A. as well.  And hopefully if nothing else this will make Hong Kong a TRUE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE!!!!

42,What Blizzard and the NBA Taught Us,256,dfrzcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfrzcv/what_blizzard_and_the_nba_taught_us/,24,"To fight a giant, we need allies.

Both the NBA and Blizzard incidents gave us inspiration. The US and the free world has been pretty silent about HK all the way till last week. Mostly, it's because they had not had a stake in the game. And the CCP dummies were right there to give them one  --subversion of the American value.

Americans are lazy and like to fight among themselves, until you give them a reason to unite. The new Coke, 9-11, or now, the violation of free speech. The thing is, them Chinese commies have been pretty sneaky about their tactics in the past decade. They infiltrate the American media under the radar, getting hold of the financial stakes of the likes of Activision-Blizzard and Disney.

But just like the 曱甴 that they are, subversive activities collapse under exposure to the light. Let me elaborate on one of the worst mismanagement on CCPs part: After Morey's tweet, the CCP could have tightened the censorship against Twitter, warned the NBA to ""not have it happen again or else"", and swatted down any domestic mentions of the Morey tweet with a heavy hand like they always did. And the whole incident could have been swept under the rug in total silence, and they could have saved a whole lot of busywork domestically and internationally.

BUT THEY DIDN'T! They forced a couple public announcements, Adam Silver, reluctantly, had to side w/ the ""good ol' American value"", and now the Chinese people are likely out of the option of watching the NBA. 

And we should replicate this incident (or dare I call it a surprise win) to many other American industries, particularly Hollywood.

First, let me explain why. China's contemporary culture is total garbage, mostly by its own doing w/ the culture crackdowns. In their own language, 所謂金玉其外，敗絮其中. They rely on the Hollywood imports to fill the spiritual void, after some heavy censorship, of course. Now, imagine a life without Hollywood imports in China. How long can they sustain, when all they have on their cinema screens are the propaganda garbage like 哪吒，我和我的祖國，or 中國機長? We are talking about a 10-year setback culturally. If you wanna break apart a power like China, rousing domestic discontentment should be the first step. And starving its people the cultural consumption might just do the deed, fairly quickly too. For example, not everybody in China is in favor of the NBA ban (https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/2941552). Given proper cultivation, this disagreement could become something stronger and more overt.

Second, let's talk about the feasibility. It's evident that Corporate America will not wittingly abandon China without any provocation. It is A LOT OF MONEY after all. But what the NBA and Blizzard incidents have shown is that when push comes to shove, they can't have both markets. China or American market, one or the other. Then the question is simplified: who is to deliver the ultimatum? Thanks to the ill-management of the CCP, it seems an irrelevant 3rd party player might just suffice. Morey of the the NBA, BlitzChung of the Blizzard Tourney, as we have seen. And Hollywood has no shortage of celebrities who are at odds w/ China. Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford, Sharon Stone, just to name a few (and one can dream maybe one of the Marvel stars covertly hates the Chinese government). At critical public moments like the Oscars, if a figure like them speaks out against China, it might just force the corporate cocksuckers to declare a stance: pro-democracy, or pro-Chinese money. And we then watch the shit storm unveil in China.

So instead of pleading to the politicians to openly oppose the Chinese regime, which they will likely not do at the risk of an all-out conflict, let appeal to our potential Hollywood allies. Write to them, tweet at them, tag them on social media. Wake up the Americans about the Chinese subversion, and force the corporations to make a stance.

TL;DR: if we can't win the fight from outside in, we choke them out from within. Force the American media companies to withdraw, and starve the Chinese culturally and rouse the domestic discontentment.",2019-10-10 13:08:19

Thank you for your interest in supporting and learning more about the situation in Hong Kong.

Here's some questions you may have and some answers:

1. **What can I do to support the movement in Hong Kong?**  
Please check out the following thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how\_can\_you\_help\_hong\_kong\_protests\_from\_abroad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/)  
We appreciate the Mei memes but we're seeing a lot of duplicate threads being created here. If it's just some random meme you've found on the internet and not something you created yourself, odds are that somebody has already posted it. Please upvote that post rather than create a new thread. News and other things are getting buried in noise.
2. **What are the protests about?**  
Hong Kong is NOT fighting for complete independence from China. The protesters have 5 demands:
   1. Full withdrawal of the extradition bill
   2. A commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality
   3. Retracting the classification of protesters as “rioters”
   4. Amnesty for arrested protesters
   5. Dual universal suffrage, meaning for both the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive
3. **Where can I learn more about the protests?**  
Here's a bit of background reading that I recommend: [https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions)

I would rather have newcomers feel welcome here even if I've already seen what they have to say dozens of times.

60,"Instead of Blizzard, people should boycott TikTok",110,dg8jw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dg8jw5/instead_of_blizzard_people_should_boycott_tiktok/,11,"For those not in the know, TikTok is wholly owned by ByteDance, a Chinese internet company whose main business in China is TouTiao.

TouTiao is China's biggest news aggregator app, complicit in distributing mass amounts of propaganda and misinformation to its 200 million daily active users each day. TouTiao, along with Tencent news, and Netease News, are all part of the mass state propaganda machine designed to distract the Chinese public from the truth. When they are not delivering propaganda, they are spewing out straight misinformation most of the time. A misinformed population is a population easy to manipulate.

But nobody in the west seems to give a shit about TikTok? Instead, people are circlejerking on Blizzard and NBA, two companies in a long list of corporations who have caved to Chinese demands in the past.

Caving to Chinese demands is the price of doing business in China. I've worked in the past couple of years as a marketing consultant in Mainland China, and you would be hard-pressed to find any foreign company in China who hasn't caved to Chinese demands ever.

The biggest enemies of authoritarianism are not missiles nor tanks, but cars and washing machines. Forcing these companies out of China will only further isolate the Chinese consumers, limiting their options and potentially their entry points to the world outside China. It's the same shit with the Google debacle a couple of years ago - Google wanted to launch a censored version of their search engine in China, but was shouted down by the internet. This WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING FOR THE CHINESE, for people would have another option outside of Baidu, a heavily skewed and censored search engine, and better for promoting the flow of ideas in China.

Seriously, boycott TikTok instead.",2019-10-11 12:19:33

It hurts me deeply to see one of my favorite game companies transformed into a cesspool of filth due to greed. But you know what hurts more?

Watching the people you love  get murdered in front of you. Watching your city, once a shining beacon of freedom, get burned down. Watching all your basic freedoms evaporate.

Part of being a hero is standing up for what's right, not your best interests. I am not a hero,  but I will do everything in my power to support those that are on the streets fighting for their democracy everyday.

For this reason, we will be removing all Blizzard affiliated rewards from our app, [Hero Trainer](https://hero-trainer.com).  I have personally uninstalled Battle.net and all Blizzard games. While we are small startup and doubt this will make any substantial impact, it is the right thing to do.

Our decision is final like the lives taken by China.

And yet, game publisher Blizzard did exactly that after Hong Kong-based pro gamer Blitzchung advocated for his own political freedom during a livestream. 

While some companies like Blizzard have shown a willingness to censor your free speech, other companies like Epic have [pledged to support](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906110/blizzard-hearthstone-ban-hong-kong-china-epic-games-fortnite-blitzchung) the rights of their customers, employees, and fans around the world. Now we're keeping score.

We need to get every game company on the record stating whether they do or do not support free speech, and if they will allow their players to advocate for their own freedom. Our new site makes it easy for you to tweet at every major game publisher, and tell them to take a position. It also shows where the companies stand on free speech.

In many interviews Davis Advisors state that they own Alibaba (and other Chinese companies) which are in charge of the vast majority of transactions between governmental entities within China. *This is something I have yet to see reported!!!!* Why is nobody talking about this? 2 out of the 3 big investors (Tencent and Davis Advisors) are directly involved in Chinese governmental operations and put up the bulk of the money invested in the company to ""free"" itself.

If people are wondering why Blizzard bends the knee to China it is because they are using some really comfy wallets from Tencent and Davis Advisors to pad their knees...

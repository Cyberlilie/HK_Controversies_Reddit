https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1181442535962632193), Blizzard has removed Hong Kong Hearthstone player blitzchung from Hearthstone Grand Masters, rescinded all his prize money, and have suspended him from pro play for one year for his recent interview., *uninstalls battle. Net*, I was going to resubscribe to play Classic, but if this is their stance, I’d rather buy a bloody EA game. Join me in boycotting Blizzard, if you are currently subscribed and intend to unsubscribe, make sure you write this as the reason on the questionnaire.

Edit: Obligatory thanks for the Silver! I’m happy to see so many people, not just here but in other Blizzard communities, take a stand on this issue and say this is unacceptable!, Boycott Overwatch that is about to come out on Nintendo Switch, Here is one situation where  a boycott may be in order. Let’s see if people are willing to give up those sweet sweet games though, Just a reminder that Tencent is a 5% stakeholder in Activision Blizzard. They also recently signed a massive NBA deal.

HMMMMM

EDIT: To respond to all the replies - I'm not saying this is the *reason* this happened. I'm just saying it's another aspect of the situation.,  Boycott **Blizzard!!!!!!**, I am now boycotting blizzard...going to uninstall [battle.net](https://battle.net) from my pc., Heard the news and instantly uninstalled Hearthstone, the fact that they did this is cowardly and disgusting., It was no really surprise given how they turned Diablo into a mobile pay2win., This is legit the best way of performing a stress test to see if China's business matters more than the rest of the world's., I haven't given them money since Activision got involved. Activision is, and always has been, a trashy company.

---

Never forget the Tienanmen Square Massacre (Chinese: 天安门大屠杀)!

光復香港 時代革命!

Free Tibet!

Protect the Uyghurs!

Release Inner Mongolia!

Support Taiwan!, I've left poor reviews for their games and mentioned this being the reason why.

Get on board, they are people first, a company second. Human rights before profit., Currently in the process of deleting my blizzard account. Don't just uninstall battle.net, delete everything you can., Man how shitty. Sure, at the end Blizzard is also just a company trying to maximize profits, but it's incredible how profits can easily make them throw basic human rights like just stating your own opinion over board., Here is a copy of the email I sent them this morning. Waiting for a response before I delete the account completely. 

&#x200B;

Good Morning, 

I was just curious as to what happened to blizzard? How much money would we need to raise to get you off of China's funds? Banning a esports player for supporting Hong Kong is by far the most disgusting action this company has done and you guys partnered with Activision!! As a company you make a weak claim that you are protecting your image by attempting to silence this person, however in doing so you have proven your real opinion. Blizzard cares more about profit then about the freedom the people there are fighting for. Shame on this company. I know it's not much for one person to stop playing anything related to blizzard but I'll be doing so and encouraging my friends to do the same. Perhaps you have missed the video's of emergency services in tears because they are being physically blocked from assisting protesters, or the video of children as young as 10 being arrested. How about the videos of peaceful protesters being shot in the face with bags and losing their eyes? How much is their eye worth blizzard?  Maybe you've missed the news where they've banned masks in an attempt to arrest more people. Maybe you've missed the recent news that protesters have been shot with real ammunition now versus the bags. I'm glad you are in America where you can openly run your business with no issues of the government ever limiting your freedoms. I hope your office is nice and cozy while these people fight for their freedom. You've made your opinion clear blizzard. Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time., i'm ok to boycott blizzard, stopped playing their games since diablo2 lol, The funny thing is this:

The founders of Blizzard are Americans, the land of the free. They live in a country where democracy exists. They can sit in their offices, watch South Park, drink coffee, say whatever they like, do whatever they like, without fear of persecution.

And they do this to a Hong Kong player, because of money. 

Are they not rich enough? Are they so scared of their board members? Are they so scared of their investors?

I am not a Blizzard fan, and I certainly will never be a Blizzard fan.

PS: yes, I deliberately mentioned South Park.

Edit: persecution, not prosecution!, Blizzard has sucked for a very long time though, Don't worry, I've stopped buying anything Blizzard after they massacred my boy, Diablo, Why am I enthusiastic about boycotting spineless companies?
Yes.
Especially the gaming industry which is supposed to be one of the frontlines of uniting people from every corner of the world, their kowtow to a totalitarian regime makes me wanna puke., fuck this trash company, Boycotted, Already canceled and downloaded a private server for WoW Classic.  Blizzards never getting my money again., dOn'T yOu GuYs HaVe CiViL rIgHtS?

Fuck blizzard, fuck Disney, fuck NBA., Too bad, I liked Hearthstone. Never going to buy another pack., I took a look at my game library and I can proudly say...

""I didn't spend a dime on Blizzard, period."", I've been a supporter of Blizzard for over a decade. I have had a WoW subscription for probably 8 of those 10 years. Cancelled it today and will no longer support this company. At some point they have to make a stand for what is right., Well, I play Blizzard games. But haven't spent a dime on Blizzard for 2 years. Does that count as boycott?  Or does playing their games alone make them money?, Uninstalled. No time for this nonsense., I have no clue how a company could benefit from a free society with human rights and freedom of speech and then turn around and ban others for that very reason. It makes my blood boil how they value cash more than human rights., I have like a dozens of friends cancelling the preorder of the upcoming COD., Can't lose that sweet commie money, can they., Unsubbing from WoW, atleast for a time. I am quite busy with uni so haven't gotten to play much Classic but was subbed so i could log on when i felt like it, but fuck this., Activision, too, was gonna buy CODMW (beta was fun) but no, hell no, they sucked anyway. Never buying one again, way ahead of you, haven't bought anything of theirs for years, Is this even legal? Obviously Blizzard lawyers think so, so it probably is... but I thought this would fall foul of anti-discrimination laws.

EDIT: I see the TOS now that he supposedly violated, though that doesn't in itself make it legal. Like if someone revealed they were transgender and got the same treatment, I assume they would be in legal trouble.,  Sent in my [account deletion request](https://puu.sh/EqcXq/cc2e12efef.png) Fuck blizzard, Realize that most major gaming companies are owned by Chinese companies and 90% of the time it's Tencent, I hope those talking about abandoning Blizzard are also gonna abandon any other company producing in china that isn't condoning the action taking place in HK., Blizzard should ban themselves cause they just offended a portion of the public and damaged their own image., Destiny has left battle.net

There is literally no interesting games in their client right now, except for WoW, Everyone seems to be forgeting about activision, that means call of duty, Played wow for years, purchased damn Near every game they've made, spent a decent amount on hearthstone. Just deleted my account, go eat a big bag of dicks Blizzard!, Uninstalling when I get home tonight.  Blizzard & Activision can eat an entire bag of dicks.

They are not getting another dime out of me., Fuck Blizzard, This dude is really fucking brave for doing what he did. Really puts his own life on the line for others liberty!, It's not much.. but its about as much as I can do here in America.

[https://imgur.com/a/PQx9281](https://imgur.com/a/PQx9281), What the shit Blizzard, I thought you were cool., Fuck Blizzard., Wait, so he was a HK native? They seriously banned a guy for standing with his country? What the fuck?, Canadian here, been playing blizzard games since I was a kid. I’m cancelling my WoW sub and trying to get a refund on my Blizzcon ticket and WC3 Preorder. Blizz sold out to the devil., Fuck blizzard, Jokes on blizzard, now that destiny's gone I uninstalled the launcher, I don't like blizzards games really, I cancelled my subscription as soon as I found out., Blizzard has become a money thirsty company ever since Activision laid its dirty hand on it. Haven't been playing their games for a while already., Well then. Guess who's cancelling their WoW subscription?

Me. In case that wasnt clear. First I outlawed EA products in my home, blizzard are now on the list., Hey, one more reason to hate Activision-Blizzard Corporation!

I suppose I should thank the slimy reprobates, this is showing the Hong Kong situation to a lot of people who may not have heard about it until now. Mad props to BlitzChung for holding firm!, First NBA, then Activation-Blizzard, this is what's gonna happen to the world if CCP keep on getting away from violating human rights. The public must speak up and stand firm against censorship and the total authoritarian regime. Hong Kong might be the frontline of such movement, but the world should rally together before it is too late., >	As Andy reported earlier today, Blitzchung did not back down after the sudden removal of the broadcast, during which he wore a gas mask and goggles before shouting “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!” Following the incident he released a statement elaborating on his stance, writing “I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it’s my duty to say something about the issue.”

Dude’s got magnitudes more spine than Blizzard., Hey I didn’t anyway so no reason for me to even try WoW, Well that fucking sucks. I love Blizzard and Blizzard games. They sure as hell don't make it easy to delete your account, fucc corporations. they mainly wanna associate with china for profits, All these corporations bowing down to a modern nightmare nation-state will lose my business. I'm sure the fake Chinese Twitter accounts will make up the business though., sadly gonna have to not buy a wow sub this year and so forth... sad i love HS and WOW not the way i wanted this company to go..., Alright then i really wanted to play overwatch again, not anymore, Blizzard has been complete garbage for a long time. Boycott away~~, Hey, a way to show support for the people in Hong Kong AND get more people to play TF2? I'm down!, >Not taking a political stance is a political stance

&#x200B;

>\[What blizzard is doing is\] A bit like taking a stand against a government that is beating its citizen to death, harvesting organs from political prisoners and running death camps., [Guess I am done with WoW.](https://imgur.com/gallery/LGi8zWh) It was fun while it lasted., I was going to buy Diablo 3 on PC this weekend, but I think I'll just torrent it instead., Deal., Weird.  I was planning on reopening my hearthstone account today but I guess I won't then, Fuck them, What a piece of shit company. They did not have to do this., Effective immediately: uninstalling overwatch and will no longer be purchasing on switch., Way ahead of you. Blizzard has been known to not be consumer friendly at all for years. To me this is the cherry on top of the shit cake., Cancelled my sub, I did not ,they were free xd, Done, Deleted Overwatch today. 

Ciao., A Hearthstone competitor (Gods Unchained - based on the Ethereum Blockchain where you are the true owner of your crypto/cards and censorship resistant) just tweeted this: 

https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1181487505180258304

.
@Blizzard_Ent
 just banned 
@blitzchungHS
 and stripped his Hearthstone winnings because they care about money more than freedom. We will pay for ALL his lost winnings and a ticket to our $500k tournament: no player should be punished for their beliefs. #freegaming, I was looking forward to Diablo 4. 

No more., [List of Blizzard games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Blizzard_Entertainment_games)	

[List of Activision games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Activision_video_games), What games did blizzard even make that are good besides WoW?

ALSO. Why are every major game companies publisher and developers alike, coming out all of a sudden like ""Yeah fuck our fan base and customers, we don't give a fuck."", Just sold all my atvi stock fuck blizzard, The players and casters violate the tournaments' rule, and that's why they are removed.  This is ridiculous to boycott Blizzard just because they are following through the tournament rules.  You should boycott all gaming tournaments in Hong Kong that have related rules as well., Fuck blizzard

Fuck china

Fuck Xi Jinping, What's interesting is that if the player instead advocated for China and **against** Hong Kong, Blizzard would have done the exact same thing yet the spin wound be ""Blizzard is fighting for Hong Kong by banning pro China player"" and they would be getting praise.

The rules clearly state that their platform should not be used for politics. It goes both ways... And it's a perfectly normal rule to have., Huge Blizzard Fan boy for about 10 years or more.  
Played almost all of their games .  
Heard about this -> Deleted everything.  
I can't support greedy companies that have 0 moral over money.   
^(Fuck you, Blizzard.), This is sad news. I love overwatch and OWL but I love human rights more....I can no longer support blizzard now, It’s fun watching my favorite gaming company (since the release of Warcraft 2) flush all of the respect I have for it down the drain. :/, yikes blizzard, time to go play some oldschool runescape, Not that I play their games to begin with, so boycotting will be incredibly easy for me. Still, I really hope this news kicks Blizzard in the financial balls. If they don't, the general message to corporations is going to be ""throwing basic human rights under the bus is ok as long as you make enough money from it"", then things are going to take a serious tumble downhill from there..., The same corporate proxy that the Chinese Communist Party uses to carry out economic reprisals on Americans in this story is called Tencent.

From the first article about this that was able to make it to the front page;

""Morey later deleted it, but not before Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta saw it on Twitter and quoted it with a response clarifying that it was not the franchise’s position.

A day later, numerous Chinese sponsors, and even the Chinese Basketball Association — with former Rockets franchise icon Yao Ming as its president — suspended their ties with the team.

In addition, Tencent Sports announced Sunday that all live streaming and news reporting of the Rockets would be suspended. The company gave customers who bought a subscription to watch Houston games online the opportunity to pick another NBA team""

https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/debd72/us_presidential_candidate_yang_blasts_chinese/

Tencent is the company that put 150 million into Reddit that everyone was worried about;

""Tencent investment in Reddit sparks censorship worry""

https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2019/02/12/tencent-investment-in-reddit-sparks-censorship-worry

Don't say the wrong thing about China or the Chinese Communist Party will use its business proxies for economic reprisals.

We're talking on one of those business proxies right now.

If you want to save democracy in this country you get on here and tell everyone you can about Tencent and Reddit.

If there is not enough pressure you will see Reddit used in the exact same manner as all of these other corporations but Reddit is the *largest internet forum in the world*. 

Just imagine the unmitigated disaster that would befall free expression if this relationship isn't talked about **RIGHT NOW**., There are a few alternative games you might want to try out if you are considering migrating from Blizzard games:

* Loot Driven (Diablo III): Path of Exile
* MMORPG (WoW): FFXIV or Elder Scrolls Online. FFXIV is more similar to the feeling of WoW and has better PvE. I myself is trying FFXIV next.
* MOBA (HotS): HotS is not so hot anyways
* Hero Shooter (OW): I'm unfamiliar with its competitors in such a specific genre. Maybe TF2 as it is OW's predecessor.
* Real Time Strategy (War 3 and its future reboot, SC and SC2): they are still the kings of RTS and most non-Blizz RTS games came like a decade ago and don't have very populated competitive/online scenes. AOE2 HD has one, but you're probably better off waiting for the definitive edition., Please don't forget you can go to your app stores on your phone. Leave negative feedback for the battle.net authenticator and the WoW companion app., Don't forget to boycott Activision games as well.  
  
I used to play a lot of Overwatch, even going so far as getting top 2% in ranked play, but their blatant disregard and alienation of their playerbase in terms of balance and PR was apparent long ago - which made me quit. This only solidifies it., Is blizzard planning on selling their games to the Chinese government or to its citizens? Because if I were a Chinese citizen and knew that Blizzard pulled this shit, I would avoid their games from then on. And It’d be an effective way to protest without getting beat in the streets., ...]",2019-10-08 19:24:58

They say they don't get involved in politics yet by pulling this shit they've indeed already involved themselves, In the defence of blizzard, i think its just that they dont want there competitions and competitive scene to be filled with politics and stuff like that and try to keep people thrilled on the game rather then hong kong to keep people on a brught side if the mind, plus like its a massive company...they have to protect there image, [effacé],   #FuckBlizzard #IStandWithHongKong, I read that the NBA had to issue an apology about a Pro-Protestor tweet from one of their team managers because there was a huge backlash from Chinese citizens.

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000., Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age.

2,This years Blizzcon (Blizzard convention) will take place from October 31 - November 2 in the Anaheim Convention Center in LA! I propose this idea to you: Everybody should dress up as Winnie the Pooh or other pro Hong Kong/ anti China symbols to make it the worst possible experience for Blizzard!,26804,dfy8cj,https://i.redd.it/fiwmd6t1wpr31.jpg,456,,"[I want to clarify my post a bit:

I do not mean ""Go buy Blizzcon tickets to demonstrate inside of the convention"", what I meant is that if you already have tickets then, instead of  just not going you could use them to protest inside and everybody else that wants to protest should do so, but outside, to not financially support Blizzard any more.

Edit: You couldn’t buy tickets anymore even if you wanted, Everyone dress up as Pro-HK Mei, A knock off [Winnie the Pooh](https://www.wowhead.com/news=286599/winnie-the-pooh-reference-in-stormsong-valley) is actually in the game. Everyone do a Hunter cosplay., I wish I lived in LA so I could protest this. Never played the game but Blizzard's behaviour is shocking., I want to see protests and the event ruined. I want to see their news get burried by protests and Poohs, Legions of Winnie the Poohs and Meis.  It would be glorious., How about everyone boycott Blizzcon instead? Or protest outside wearing Pooh costumes?, I’m out of the loop. Why does The Chinese Gov dislike Winnie the Pooh?, This is the new raid area 51 thing but instead it's ""Go to Blizzcon and dress up in pro-Hong Kong related stuff, they can't kick us all out"", Sneak a question about it to all the live panels possible.

It was really funny but dumb the last year with the April fools question, it would be AMAZING this year., I propose dressing up as Winnie the pooh cosplaying Mei from overwatch., [effacé], [effacé], Raid Blizzcon in Winnie the Pooh suit, they can't stop all of us, Do you not have yuan?!??, Boycott if you haven't purchased a ticket.

Let's not bucket every single person in China because we need more support not alienation. :), Nice idea but I’d like to know where this photo was taken and why they were all wearing those costumes.

Do it!, Would be better not to attend imo but it would be hilarious otherwise., Damn, i wish i was there, i would not only dress up as winnie the pooh but also buy winnie the pooh teddy bears and just give them out for free!, The Anaheim convention center is in Anaheim not LA, How about nobody go. No one buy a ticket. Companies like this speak one language: money., TBF most blizzard employees especially in the Irvine branch are absolutely on HK side and are sick of having to change their games for China, it’s corporate that’s responsible., FUCK CHINA, How about refunds and not going?, Or just don't go and protest as Pooh outside., Or dress up as Mei. Support Hong Kong, People should do this at the NBA games... imagine an audience full of Poohs., Also i want to say that if you are going, please please please be safe! You are going to help the cause, not make the cause seem worse, so like please don’t beat people up etc, and remember safety procedures, 

Oh and of course, have fun!!


That is if well they don’t cancel the event first, Damn, my time to dress up as Eric Cartman has arrived, Didn't they ban Winnie the Pooh cosplays? Or was that just a meme because I really fucking hope it was, Dressing up as Mei is gonna be the next political statement, They're going to have a stupid excuse and then kick everyone out, Just keep in mind that Blizzard amended the rules to ban Winnie the Pooh costumes. Whoever does this will be thrown out, unless a lot of people do it., wait what happened?, Or as a joke, stop paying them loads of money to show you  a bunch of ads, I saw some release from them saying they are banning all Winnie the Pooh content from entering blizzcon. I could be wrong and though., It's not that I'm against this idea, but buying Winnie the Pooh materials gives money directly to Disney who is also guilty of vending the knee! If you already have WtP stuff then that's awesome but I encourage you to choose something else. 

That being said, WtP is a great way to protest either way so you do you, no judgement from me. Protesting at BlizzCon is essay more important at the moment., This year is gonna be a even bigger disaster, Maybe I should ask this in /r/AskReddit but, what is the connection between WTP and China? I understand the Blizzard thing, even to the point that they won't let you end your account (if I am understanding that correctly) but the Winnie The Pooh deal. Most memes I get but I'm lacking on this one., Isnt thi that guy who runs Hong Kong?, I am so fucking down for this, I'm close enough that I'm willing to take a trip, You can also wear a red clothing piece on the upper body and tan pants. Should work as well for a cheaper alternative., I would be surprised if Blizzcon didn't get canceled this year. They have made if almost definite that people are going to fuck with them about the China shit., I've attended the past 5 or 6 Blizzcons but will be skipping this one (mostly because Blizzard games have had a sharp decline in quality). However, in past years there are always religious people protesting uh I guess the devil? Just pointing out you don't need a ticket to go there and protest. The anaheim convention center is mostly out in the open, and I believe the food trucks and stuff is also out in the open., Or just don't go to Blizzcon., Where was that winnie the pooh picture taken?, >in the Anaheim Convention Center in LA!

In Anaheim, *near* LA., This Winnie the Pooh thing. It’s really stupid and started as a joke so it’s a bad symbol., They'll just say it never happened and the chinese government will agree, I love it!, Just a heads up, the Anaheim convention center is in Orange County, not LA, Better idea. Don’t go. Don’t give them more of your money. Just protest for free outside the venue., An army of Poohs and Meis running around Blizzcon would make my year lol, Let's set how many variations to Winnie the Pooh We the People can come up with!, And if you are pro China? Tigger?, How about not going?, ""Pay up to 750 bucks to get ejected from the event""

Sounds like a plan reddit would come up with, yup., Excuse me, It's ANAHEIM. Not LA. They already took our Angels, don't just GIVE them the Convention Center., Isn't this image from an SCP?, I love it!, I don't know. It might be a better idea to organize this protest, keep everything subtle. And then when some kind of live stream or presentation is being held, all reveal our shirts, maybe some music boxes with pro-hk music and scream free hk. Technically speaking, Blizzards hands are tied because it is freedom of speech, so long as the people do not suddenly attack or riot. Only way they could stop it is if they shut down the entire event., So you could call this..a Poohraid?, The best is if everyone stays at home. Don't sell your ticket, just don't go., Can anyone explain to me why Winnie the Pooh is a pro - Hong Kong symbol?, If you live close to the event there is no reason why you shouldn't be out there protesting.

EDIT: Unless you have to work. Or have a sick pet., This is a horrible idea. Why ruin the fun for people who are going here? This is on the same level as those BLM protestors who block the road and businesses for actual people trying to work. If you want to help Hong Kong, why not go there and actually make a difference? Trying to virtue signal by holding up a sign will do nothing. It’s like those people who say “pray for x” every time a tragedy happens. It’s useless and does nothing to help the actual victims., I really hope we see some professional cosplay of famous blizzard characters but they’re Pooh like Thrall themed Pooh or a Terran Marine but it’s Pooh’s head.

Also, of course, sexy Pooh, People should make the base of their costumes Pooh and other symbols, but customize them how they like, Just a note I hadn’t seen yet, you do NOT need a ticket to stand right outside the event center where hundreds of people hangout. So if you’re in the area get out there!, Maybe also buy Taiwan 🇹🇼 flags, That an idea we can all go behind just like area 51 i think it could be a success, Besides those, you can also think about ways to sneak pro-HK messages past the censors. There are cosplay options that allow you to semi-conceal the message. 

Genji sword, for example, painted with message that only shows when you draw it.  On the inside curve of Hanzo's bow, underside of Tracer's guns (thus visible, when posed at the barrel-up position), detachable armor panels with message underneath for the diablo/wow cosplayers...etc.  Blizzard will either have to let their security contractors put cosplayers through detailed examination (this won't fly in the #metoo age especially for some of the skimpier cosplays), or post employees that know the design and IP(intellectual property) inside and out but to pull people out of line like a commissar, or do both half measures, causing delay at entry and knowing messages will slip through.  All of that is a bad look before anyone even makes it into the convention hall., I can't believe they are still hosting it? It has a chance to be a huge black eye and hurt any product launches.

During The Burning Crusader (TBC) and Wrath of the Lich King(Wotlk). Wotlk version was delayed for nearly 2 years to be released in China, because the Government of China don' t pass the permit to Netease, and the reason is Wotlk has alot skeleton, corpse, deadbody, unholy stuff, even Blizzard did patch the Chinese Version of WoW like making Undead race don' t have bones show up (It looks like just a bald human), and when you are died, you don' t leave skeleton on the ground, instead you have a tombstone there, also They did a big patch to ICC raid, making all undead just like normal human body, and bone dragon become normal live dragon, it looks so wired.

However even Blizzard patched Wotlk to a censored version, the Government of China still not satisfied, Blizzard still paid large amount of money to Government for getting it released, no wonder why Blizzard is now so careful or even overacting, because Chinese Government did fuck Blizzard hard in past, Today, Blizzard can mess with all the players, but it' s not dare to piss Chinese Government, even it' s an American Company! Im not surprised that Blizzard did that to HK Grandmaster, Blizzard doesn' t give a fuck about it, Money is everything, for Money, Blizzard can sold out all his morality or even its soul to Chinese Government.

Blizzard: And what, CCP, must we give in return?

CCP: Everything., Tracer has a skin with a mask use her too, Glad to see this is catching on. Did a similar-ish meme with Hammond that might also be a fun way to get blizz in trouble (feel free to repost it wherever if anybody wants, no credit necessary of course)

Using the Mei meme as a template, depict a prominent Pandaran Character as a symbol of Hong Kong protests.,  #BoycottBlizzard, A **Houston Rockets' jersey** would make a good protest symbol.

Look at how they talk about their tournaments and how speaking freely outside of it is a ""violation"" of the tournament rules at their discretion. Honestly it's not worth whatever prizes they are giving to bow down to that nonsense., Blizzard also rescinded all of the prize money the player had earned in the league, Just for a quick correction: the casters actually encouraged his actions, as they said ""Say the eight words, then we’ll end the interview immediately"" before ducking

[Copied from u/n0blord](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/dew4ij/after_the_hearthstone_hong_kong_incident_blizzard/f2ze1vp/), Blizzard also took away his prize money.

Thsnks, Anyone looking to start a mass boycott on blizzard?, Aaaaaand r/Blizzard just locked itself in fear, So it's safe to say we won't get a call of duty where you fight the chinese instead of russians lmao, Greek here, I’ve been playing OW for 2.5 years. I am absolutely disgusted by Blizzard. Let’s give them hell!, Public disrepute - really? he needs to smack blizzard with an appeal tbh, I've never been this disappointed in Blizzard.

Just a few years ago I would claim Blizzard as one of the most trustworthy companies. Then they started running WoW into the ground, they ruined the Diablo series, and now they are actively defending China's blatant attack on human rights? 

This is not a good look for them and any PR team with half a brain would know that. This - in my mind at least - proves the only thing they actually care about is money. If it makes them more money to defend China attacking it's own citizens, then that's what they are gonna do., Everyone should watch the South Park episode Band in China 🇨🇳 Season 23 Episode 2 

Its the newest episode and basically touches on this exact topic. Crying ass shame., we are live from South Park, Sounds like Blizzard needs some Tegridy., ""Offends a portion or group of the public"" 

That's crybaby bullshit. Being anti-free speech is anti-American, period. I understand moderating, because some shit just isn't appropriate to have in a game, but to support pride and to not support someones statement against known tyranny is just garbage.

When it starts to affect their bottom line, they have no problems doing shit like this., Yeah its fucked, I’m tired of companies bending over and grabbing their ankles for China at the expense of the rest of the world.

But those people are missing WHY people are upset here.  China is a totalitarian regime.  This isn’t an opinion, it’s a well-documented fact; criticise China, get sent to “re-education camp” or worse.  Many American countries have buckled under to China’s oppressive demands for the reward of more dollars (google, for example).  To watch Blizzard, a giant American company, kowtow and censor like the Chinese government would demand, is sad.  Seeing the NBA, Mercedes-Benz (had to ridiculously bow and scrape for quoting the Dalai Lama), etc continue to suck up to a known violent oppressive regime because they want more money is so anti-free speech and the democratic ideals that our country was founded on.   I’m sure I’ll be shit on by fan boys for this, but this is what’s pissing me, and others, off.  Spare me the legal justifications, what’s going on in Hong Kong now will probably end in countless lives lost, and is continuously threatened by China for Taiwan next.  I’ll stand with the brave fighters in Hong Kong; some other gaming company can have my money., Such an odd issue. Should the US address foreign powers meddling with the constitutional rights of its citizens? Should it be left to gamers to decide if they continue to support Blizzard?

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing

>The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app.

And **they are staunch supporters of the CCP and operate with the goal of advancing the CCP agenda** (if not just directly run by the CCP):

>CEO Zhang Yiming issued a letter in 2018 stating that his company would ""further deepen cooperation"" with Communist Party of China authorities to promote their policies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok#National_security_concerns_in_the_US

And, **they are actively censoring the Hong Kong protest, globally.** It's the only social media site in the west where searching for #HongKong returns *no results.*

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/

Reddit is here destroying US companies for making concessions to China, which is totally fair. But, at the same time, we're all posting TikToks all over reddit, and it's a top 5 app on both Google Play and the App Store. There's a TikTok subreddit (/r/TikTokCringe/) with almost 200,000 subscribers.

I worry that we have forgotten who we're really trying to punish, here. Did Apple and Blizzard and the NBA fuck up? Yes. Do they deserve the heat? Yes. But damaging US companies to punish the CCP is a small hit. At worst, it actually *helps* the chinese economy if we boycott US companies.

Going after TikTok, who is deeply-entangled with the Chinese government (and lets be honest, probably just *is* the Chinese government) and is directly implementing China-style censorship around the globe is a much better move, IMO.

#BOYCOTT TIKTOK

EDIT: A lot of people are mentioning how they already don't use TikTok. I've never used it either. I suppose a better message than ""Boycott TikTok"" would be ""spread awareness of TikTok's global censorship and CCP agenda.""

**You can all feel free to copy/paste my above post in response to comments about TikTok across reddit.** I don't mind.","[Sigh, ok.  Account deleted.  App uninstalled.  I'll switch the addiction over to duolingo., Aaah, thanks for letting me know, I'm deleting my account and the app ASAP., Oh, and if this wasn't enough reason to boycott... Tiktok, you may recall, was formerly called ""Musical.ly."" Musical.ly was sued by the FTC for $5.7 Million (the biggest civil penalty for a child protection case in the FTC's history).

Musical.ly was purposefully targeting children and collecting their data, knowing full well that it was illegal. The result? A whole lot of sexual abuse.

>That's a problem, the government says, because several of the app's default features implicate children's privacy. Unless the relevant settings are changed, profiles are public and all users can direct messages at any other user.

>""Indeed, there have been many public reports of adults trying to contact kids via the Musical.ly App,"" states the complaint. ""Until October 2016, the App had a feature where a user could tap on the 'my city' tab, which provided the user with a list of other users within a 50-mile radius, and with whom the user could connect and interact with by following the user or sending direct messages.""

>The government claims Musical.ly knew its app was popular with children under 13. 

>""Through the Musical.ly App, Defendants collected personal information as defined in the COPPA Rule, including first and last name; online contact information; the content of direct messages between users; photos and videos containing a child’s image and voice, and, for some period of time, geolocation information,""

Basically, fuck TikTok., By the way. Phones with the whole background permission checking thing sometimes pick up tiktok using the microphone permission in the background while it's not open., I’m 32 years old and I don’t even know what TikTok is., This post is so valuable. Thank you, The moment you feel unconnected from the new generation and you have to google wtf is tiktok., Tiktok censors LGBT content. What’s next?, Done. Deleted., indeed tiktok is HUGE in China., *5 year old child dances with winnie the poo* *5 Year old child gets banned on tiktoc, and the ccp keeps their eyes on her from now on*, Personally I thought most TikTok posts looked fake and staged anyway., Most of the meme community will uninstall it purely because of cringe, but this works to, fuck China, Even the less politically inclined people should get behind boycotting TikTok, if for nothing but the general cringiness of its contents., Considering it's popularity among western audience and even military personnels, as well as the fact that every entity in China is owned by the ccp de facto... How in the hell is this app not considered spyware?, And tiktok sucks in general, so win win!, They also record your face and save it for data collection, adding it to the massive central China database., Absolutely do NOT forget about the others. #boycottallofem, I just gave it a one star review. Hopefully more people do the same., League of Legends is owned by Tencent., Just sold my Activision/Blizzard stock and reinvested it into a Vanguard $VOO fund, I cannot support a company that supports the dictatorship of China., Supporting this boycott not because of political reasons, but just the fact that this platform is extremely toxic, Been doing that from day 1 when I found out what it was and realized nothing good would come of it. This really doesn't come as a surprise., I reported it for other objection and wrote stand with Hong Kong!, They are also allowing a massive surge of propaganda bots into their system.  Just scroll their home feed for awhile and you will get all of this US right wing/left wing propaganda accounts., I just downloaded the app to be able to give it a review.

It didn’t even finish downloading before I wrote the 1 star review., I am on the app, I have been aware of its chinese influence.  Not going to delete my account though, instead I will keep posting pro Hon Kong and anti CCP videos.  Right now if you search up ""HongKong"" in the app the first video tat shows up is mine, and the thumbnail is Xinnie the Pooh, its a video of me explaining very simply chinese censorship of Winnie the pooh, and then show an image Of Xi and Winnie side by side.  I see disruption from within the app as a possible route for protest.  I started the #Istandwithhongkong on the app, and people have already started using it., I've never used tiktok, and didn't realize they existed outside of china.  kind of like QQ or WeChat, Im loving how much light is being shed on the shady practices of so many companies. HK might go down in history as the beginning of something much bigger than just China. We're starting to see the true intentions of large companies!, I downvote every post I see on reddit that uses TikTok, then I comment telling them I downvoted only because of that.

I’m hoping if enough people do that then nobody will use it as they don’t get a positive reaction from it., Already forgotten. There are pirate streams of NBA games, I've switched to androids with no plan to go back to apple, deleted my blizzard account, and I don't even know what tiktok is., TikTok is censoring LGBTQ+ content too, This is so important. How can we get kids to understand and not support their own manipulation? Spreading awareness for adults is firstly important. If we don't support it, kids might catch on. I don't know much about Tik Tok but I recently became more aware of it from a comedian couples podcast ""your moms house"". I believe they're targeting it for relevancy to stay on the edge. I'm going to do what I can to contact and inform. We gotta stop this shit from spreading. Thanks OP., Boycotting a Vine clone app is like boycotting Instagram to hurt the US, not very effective. Tiktok is used by high schoolers and young adults to do Fortnite dancing over rap songs, it's not like Facebook where you log a ton of personal info that can be used against you.

And actual HKers arent using any of these govt approved apps, TikTok is cringy as hell ., What about Google?, Won't work, Tiktok's main demographic is kids that don't care., Aight mad easy.

Not like anybody would miss it. XD, or, boycott them all?, Glad that I have never used it in the first place., This is why I never got the app in the first place, Or install it. Give a bad review with something HK related and delete it again., You can boycott more than one company at once, you know., wtf is tiktok, Should I install, give it a bad rating, and then uninstall? Or just leave it alone?, WAY ahead of you on all of those lol., I already don't use TikTok. So... I guess I'm supporting the cause?, Repost the post (or use a bot) into the comments so that us mobile users can copy the text, Boycott PUBG and League of Legends as well., Why not boycott them all?, They’re also incredibly homophobic, Can someone cross post this to r/tiktokcringe and r/tiktokhumor, Oh hell yeah, further reason to hate Tik Tok, Not just TikTok but Wechat as well. It is owned by Tencent., CCP shills are also [using TikTok to dox protestors](https://np.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/d5gzdb/china_is_doxing_nationals_who_are_choosing_to/)., I installed just to leave this review.|
Fuck you and your company. You don't get to decide what content is acceptable for the rest of the world. You don't get to censor free speech for citizens of other countries. Fuck the Chinese communist party, and fuck your president Winnie the Pooh, I've been boycotting tik tok ever since those stupid adds on YouTube., Neckbeards and the like do not use tik tok anyways., I don't have the app, so I'll install it, uninstall it, and give it a 1-star review, Tik Tok wasn't good to begin with. Apple is over priced and I have never and will never buy any of their products. I have no interest in the NBA and the only thing I ever bought from Blizzard was Overwatch and I don't even play that any more., wait, people are on tiktok?, Brb im gonna go get banned from tiktok, Thank you. I just assumed everyone knew Tiktok was Chinese garbage. I will start telling people explicitly., Can someone inform me what Apple did?, I never had TikTok because of its ties with a Chinese company.  It made me distance myself from it further when I heard about censorship within the app., Hated tiktok anyway, so we good ;), They have also banned all LGBTQ+ content from their platform. All of it. Guys kissing, girls proposing to someone who’s not a straight guy, all of if., Don't forget. Boycott them all., I have never heard of TikTok, guess i can just keep ignoring its existence, Reddit is my one stop shop for who to be outraged at, thanks guys, Middle aged man here. I’ve been boycotting them from the beginning. What is it you say they do again?, Meanwhile the New York Times: [48 Hours in the Strange and Beautiful World of TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html?action=click&module=Editors%20Picks&pgtype=Homepage), fuck TikTok, #HongKong comes up what are you talking about? #HongKong also has 143 million views., Way ahead of you - I never corrupted my phone in the first place, You mean cringe and stupid Youtube ads aren't a reason enough to not use TikTok?, What’s really shocking for me is that TikTok has a 4.7/5 review score.

Based on 175K ratings. On App Store

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320, I deleted that horrid piece of garbage because a guy picking his nose gets 10M views but actual good original interesting content gets buried.  Yeah im bitter, heh.  But I want to encourage everyone to delete that garbage anyways., I’ve been boycotting that terrible app since it was released. But I really wish I could boycott seeing the annoying ads too., Fuck yeah. Show them that they need to follow western rules if they want the trust from people in the west., Just say goodbye to all the Chinese tech companies/products and you are good...for the time being at least :), Thanks. Don’t have the app. But I have it a 1 star review anyway cos fuck them., What’s a tiktok, tiktok is such garbage and its more than just about being yet another tool of the CCP, Why boycott any platform at all when you can leverage it to distribute your message?
At their expense.

What we need is TikTok rock stars [wearing these t-shirts](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dg9o72/free_hong_kong_shirts_for_san_francisco_nba/) while they do their thing., The fuck is tiktok?, Reinstalled just to delete account. Uninstalled again., I think the biggest impact we could have on the Chinese popular opinion would honestly be getting all major game companies banned in China. They have their own stuff but if wow, LoL, overwatch, HS, Steam and every mobile game as well, that would make a whole bunch of people mad. Pipedream, since capitalism doesn't care about democracy, but I could wish, I rather use Tiktok to express my support in the protest, Gave it one star on Google Play., That’s pretty wacky, Will it delete videos of people holding up a HK flag?, I have an account but I've been using it to spread awareness in the comments. There are lots o content creators there with big platforms who might not be as aware of this issue as Reddit is. If we could get the users who aren't gonna delete the app to spam HK support, then that could be a good thing., As a person without a tiktok, what can I do to boycott it harder?, I already don't use TikTok, partly cause censored platforms just aren't safe., Lol I’ve been posting photos of Xi as Winnie the Pooh and Tank Man and they keep removing them, That edit is key. Thanks for this., Uninstall wechat, tiktok, any app or software that's CCP backed., Thank you my friend -- I was considering getting TikTok, but not anymore., Can’t boycott if you’ve never had the app!!!, ...]",2019-10-11 21:38:59

I’ve been out of the loop on everything about the HK protests since they began and have been trying to find out., Banned for 1000 years hits different than banned permanently, 1000 years?

They can go chortle the balls of that Winnie the Pooh looking fascist bitch., Damn what am I going to do for the 905 years after I am dead...  will Blizzard be around?... really , will it?, Boycott everything Blizzard., Banned for one thousand years. Banished from my fandom. And now, you dare support the PRC? You are not prepared., I had my post (talking about old activision patents and my disdain for blizzard's move) mysteriously removed twice (rather quickly, mind you) before going to r/activision and actually getting it posted there., Idea? If blizzard won’t let you delete your account just start blowing up forums with pro Hong Kong talk, I get that they are removing posts. Isn't it against their rules to bring up politics? They said they're strictly a gaming company, yes? I saw that somewhere and I don't recall anyone refuting it. Correct me if wrong, please. 

But to clasify it as *trolling*? Thats a real low move, Blizzard., Blizzard, what have you become? I didn't remember you behaving like this., Wait so if im extremely toxic but say ""Long live China!"" I wont get banned?, 1001 years later ""I lived bitch"", [effacé], what massage blizzard think they give: ""no no no pls no political statements""

I am not buying shit from them anymore., 1000 years? I only got [3 weeks](https://imgur.com/gallery/dzHInW4)., Does anyone have the email address of Blizzard executives? It'd be nice to start an email campaign of ""Fuck you and China, too"" to them.

If you are tricky about it, you incorporate ""Fuck you and China, too"" into a GIF or JPEG(stenography) so that it can't be screened for keywords and put into junk mail more easily., I'd like to see these ""discussions"" and judge for myself., isnt that illegal ?, only 1000 years, pfttttttt, What if the screenshotter tempered with the messaage (by inspecting HTML element)?

Won’t China have access to all your email/phone/address/interest/friends & family?

I wanna test it and if they ban me for a thousand years then so be it., Everyone talking about the 1k year ban but noone is mentioning the reason? I mean trolling? If this is legit from today and op really talked about hong kong aren't they saying that the protest is just trolling?

Blizzard Today: ""Every RMB matters"", Wow, so THAT's the freaking line for them? For years the Blizzard forums have been the most vile, toxic shithole of asshattery. You'd have to be an unimaginably toxic scumbag to even get a 10 day ban, but THIS is what they hand out permanent bans for?

I can't remember the name of the company, but if true, belongs down with South Park., Never thought I'd see the day South Park had better morals than two international juggernauts., Maybe there can be a gofundme page to hand out free ""Stand with Hong Kong"" t-shirts at BlizzCon, [like they're doing at the Clippers-Lakers opening game](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/deskzv/someone_made_a_gofundme_page_to_give_out_free/)? BlizzCon's supposed to be at Anaheim Convention Centre, Nov. 2-3., You’re a bit behind on the news about the NBA. [Proud of my commish](https://mobile.twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1181497808563658752), what has Blizzard done?, [effacé], Fuck china, Can someone explain why the NBA is bad? I've read that the commissioner of the NBA, Adam Silver, said something like this: ""I think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey [owner of Rockets] is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression."" https://m.imgur.com/gallery/yq2jzOU 
I'm not trying to fight or anything, I'm just curious., what did the nba do?, Except the commissioner totally did not apologize and said that he stands by the rockets GM, Blizzard is like Reek from game of thrones., Fuck Drake,  Can someone explain to me exactly whats going on with the NBA and Blizzard?, The NBA commissioner backed freedom of speech today though, Honestly, Blizzard had no choice but to revoke the guy's prize winnings. He explicitly violated the terms of his contract and he did so using Blizzard's game service as a platform. If he had, for instance, spoken out against Israel or Palestine and the conflict those two nations have with each other, the repercussions would have likely been the same. 

Blitzchung was absolutely correct to say what he said, and if I were him I would have done the same. But people acting like Blizzard could have let that slide after reading the terms of his contract are being naive., These companies seriously putting money over morals? Wow. Actually pathetic, The NBA has said that it values freedom of speech and will be protecting employees and players. Adam Silver the commissioner of the NBA will be meeting with officials in China to see if they can meet a common ground. China has informed the NBA that they will not televise the games anymore. The NBA's stance right now is ""sorry but not sorry China"", [Fuck you, Blizzard.](https://i.imgur.com/qAc8Xhm.png), Fucking reddit is in their pocket too. It’s a joke, Is there a gofundme for Stand with HK tshirts for Blizzcon attendees?
That'd be a big fuck you to them since they wouldn't be able to stream it in China., This meme is trash since the NBA released a positive statement for free speech and Hong Kong a whole four hours before this was posted., What did the NBA do?, I’m not too up-to-date on news, what did South Park do that was good?, NBA getting comfy in their grave. Shame you can't lose respect when it's an zero., It's quite refreshing because Hongkongers are used to this type of behavior by companies but now we have the backing of the American market., you should go to /r/Blizzard and see the shitstorm. the mods can't keep up, Unrelated but Stan Mash and Crimson Dawn are the greatest metal band of all time., Adam silvers statement supported freedom of speech tho, What exactly happened with the NBA again?, Would be a shame if we turned hearthstone (one of their biggest sources of income) into a pro Hong Kong symbol, Basketball is the gayest American sport. Don't feel bad. And we all know that Blizzard would've supported Nazi Germany if it made them a couple of pennies it rub together., Someone can explain plz, Food for thought. If the sides were reversed would another country do any different? Example, Fifa says that the Occupy protests were legitimate and called for upheaval of the economic system would the US not try to oppress/censor the ideas and stifle protests violently? Doesn't democracy do this too in it's own way?, Kind of hilarious that South Park is more moral than many companies. For real haha., I still hope that LeBron and other big shots at NBA speak up against China. NBA is extremely huge there, and if they really say to China to ""shove it"", then that could possibly work as a push for the Chinese to start acting up against the government and, one day, start their own protests, since Winnie and his friends are straight up taking away one of the population's most beloved things from them.

quite a few of them were still protesting themselves today by working in front of the statue on the campus.

love you guys, stay strong. we'll keep it up here as well.

\*edit: I just wanted to add there were a few of us out there today. not just the two in this picture. there was support early in the morning before a gentlemen had to go to his job. there was support during the day by a new comer as well pictured here in tropical shirt, and of course the man taking the picture. In addition to the numerous Blizzard employees. Including one who has family in Hong Kong and came out decked with her black I<3HK shirt. So much love was there for everyone.

I personally wanted to say that this is nothing compared to what you are all going through in HK. But hopefully we can bring a more fluid international awareness to the situation by protesting in our local areas. Thanks everyone.

If I didn't live half way across the country I'd be there with you., If only i lived in Cali i'd go too :/, Thank you for voicing out for HK and being so thoughtful of the employees of Blizzard's.

I love you guys., Thank you so much for this.

I’m glad it’s not just cynicism where people say the corporations will win so why fight.  Also happy to hear there are Blizzard employees inside who don’t like the censorship.

We have to be willing to support any people who want human rights and freedom.  Not just be apathetic because we take our own freedom for granted., real men, I heart you, I just named a new World of Warcraft Character Xiang Gong 香港 with a little bit of added plausible deniability ...

Bending over and taking it up the butt from big Chinese Communist companies is also very Irvine..., We all see posts of “instead of silver/gold, give to this “x” charity”, can we give to the protesters instead? I think it maybe controversial but I would like to contribute., Not boycott Blizzard but China. its time to pull down the  totalitarian., Very much appreciate what you're doing., Let's not get too hasty and make excuses for Blizzard employees.

Canadians consumers are covered by: PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000)

PIPEDA Subsection 4.9: requires organizations (Blizzard) to provide individuals with access to their personal information upon request. Organizations must specifically inform individuals of the ""EXISTENCE, USE AND DISCLOSURE"" of their personal information.

PIPEDA Subsection 8: requires that information access be granted not later than 30 days after the written request is made. Thus you will have to create a request either online through a ticket or on the Blizzard website if possible. If the support agent does not accept the request, you would ask for an escalation to upper management + the contact email/mail of Blizzard Canada's Privacy Office, or Blizzard's Chief Privacy Officer's email.

PIPEDA Subsection 4.9.4: further requires that access shall be provided at ""minimal or no cost"" to the individual requesting it

Under PIPEDA Subsection (4) Blizzard can attempt to increase the deadline of 30 days to provide your personal information in multiple ways, however, if they choose to create a bullshit reason, you are able to create a complaint to Canada's Federal Privacy Commissioner.

If Blizzard fails to respond in 30 days after receipt of the request, you can rain hell on them by submitting a formal complaint to Canada's Federal Privacy Commissioner. You can bet your ass this will cost Blizzard a ton of resources to sort it out.

**Solidarity with Hong Kong!**, I just attempted this.  I had to confirm my identity through authentication or text message.  I tried both options, but both of them told me ""too many attempts"".  I had only 1 attempt at each option.  Is blizz deliberately blocking requests now?, Swiggity swooty, Sadly I just live in Hong Kong.  So we have no special rights.

I haven't played over watch in a while so I may as well delete it.  Just as well I was too busy to check out the wow relaunch, Someone crosspost this to the Blizzard related subreddits (if they don’t get deleted)., I've been trying this but I get instantly denied and every verification method gets locked after 1 try. Even though I have entered the right information.

What's going on?, Can some one please explain to me why I need to request data from Blizzard and what the effects of that would be? I'm trying to boycott blizzard but I'm not too up to date. Could someone help me out a bit?, Let's not forget the major players here, Tencent. Tencent's probably biggest global market is Riot Games/League of Legends.

With the League world's going on right now I feel like some support from the teams participating, players, and spectators could also make a powerful point. Perhaps we can get the League community on board and really make this a strong push as a group of gamers., They blocked me from attempting again after 1 attempt.

Is this even legal? They are denying me my own personal info., What the hell?!

I can't verify my account to request this nor delete my information. Got an error message saying ""too many attempts"" and some other shit. Not even my ID worked.   


What the ACTUAL fuck?, Do it. F\*ck Blizzard., No. I mean, go ahead and request your data if you like, but it’s not going to do anything.

First of all, this only applies to citizens of the EU.

Second, Blizzard/Activision are large enough organizations to have these processes automated. No actual human is likely to go through their systems and compile your data.

Even if they did, they have the right to prolong the deadline to 60 days if they have cause — like too many requests.


Hefty fines could happen, but most likely won’t. I don’t think any company has been fined thus far., They have to respect the GDPR only if you are a resident of EU., *Solidarity with Hong Kong*, I am doing my part., Never had an account with Blizzard and now I never will. And even better, any residual guilt about pirating WC3 recently is nicely absolved! Grow a spine Blizzard.

PS. I buy all games through Steam (definitely not pro-piracy at all) but I choose carfeully where my hard-earned $ go.,  There is no legitimate reason to  require new, additional and never before shared (with Blizzard, Inc.)  protected PII in order to process my lawful account removal request.

**I  can only provide and/or verify the exact same information that  Blizzard, Inc. originally accepted as valid and sufficient account  information for the purposes of creating an online account.**, Create alt account then delete it and request data, meh.. https://imgur.com/a/5ZYOGhV
""Due to too many attempts, SMS Protect Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification."" First attempt.. Their servers are overloaded already?, They want to verify my identity, i should send in a copy of my passport via ticket system.  

uuuhm... how about, no., i'm legitimately curious as to what data they have from me (e.g. if they have Trade/Barrens chat logs from TBC when i started), who would have thought this would backfire so much, If your request fails, you can submit a ticket that specifically asks that your data is removed. In my case I got notified that it also failed because another request is in progress, and I got an email confirming the reception of one.

By the way, does asking to access your data really allow you to delete it? They could just send you files and allow you see the data they have on you, and bam ticket closed., It's asking for an id, but if you e-mail them at [privacy@blizzard.com](mailto:privacy@blizzard.com) , you can make the request anyways.]",2019-10-09 15:40:39

*I see a lot of people calling their credit card company to attempt payment denial coming, followed by a class-action lawsuit.*

Also according to their investment information 54% of their revenue comes from the Americas, only 12% comes from the Asia Pacific area which would no t be just China but would include South Korea, Japan, Thailand ...

So this boycott *will* hurt them.  Might already have because looks like they are trying to make it hard to delete your account and meanwhile things blow over and they hope people forget.

Wouldn't surprise me if this was actually their unsubscription services not being designed for this high a server load. Based on some of the messages it might even be that they're hitting a limit on the third party services like email providers which has now cascaded over to all of their unsubscription methods.

That'd actually be really amazing, would mean a LARGE number of unsubs.

Then again it wouldn't surprise me if they were being assholes too, so there is that..., I was just able to delete both of my Blizzard accounts.  I've been a fan of Blizzard for a very very long time, even buying Warcraft 1 and playing it on a 486.  I am Hakka but no one in my family has been born in China for 200 years.  I wish I had properly visited Hong Kong when I could, instead all my experiences were layovers in HKG.  Godbless those who are fighting for freedom in HK.    

I also wanted to add that I was very disappointed in the NBA for it's initial response, but at least unlike Blizzard they changed their tune, and looks like they're about to lose all sponsorships in China for all of the NBA for the foreseeable future., Yeah, I just tried to delete mine and the only option I was given was to submit my ID to delete my account. No way I'm doing that and just give my info away, Posting their usernames and passwords all over the Internet? What then?, I think this is too late for current companies who are knees-deep into Chinese investments, but, hopefully this will send a message to future companies to think twice before taking their money., What Blizzard is doing is illegal.

Deleting one's own account should be as simple as logging in, navigating to a button, and clicking it. Same goes for connected credit-cards.

This can be connected with a 24 hour ""delay-fuse"", where an email notification is sent to the account-holder allowing  them to revoke the request to prevent abuse.

What is happening here is Blizzard intentionally making any form of account deletion difficult, especially with accounts connected to a credit-card so as to extract payment where possible.

No company has the right to make it intentionally difficult for a customer to revoke his/her patronage. A Blizzard account/connection of a credit-card isn't some kind of Faustian loan-contract where you are bound by satanic law to keep paying with your blood., They did this in the evening yesterday, when i tried to deleted my account. I have open ticket regarding it but they have yet to get back to me., My delete request got through after a few tries, so don’t give up guys!, People living in Quebec (don’t know for Canada) this shit is borderline illegal, this could be close to infringe the right to have a private life.

If they do that, this is illegal.

Would banned accounts not hurt them financially?, If your trying to get your account deleted, why not try to get yourself banned? Is there a difference?, When I tried to delete my account, the only option I got was to send a picture of my ID. WTF! I have never bought anything with the Battle.net account, the only games I even have there are retail key activations, and keys I got from bundles. 

The only information they have on me is my name, country and email address that I had typed in myself. And even all that except the email address could be fake for all they know. 

So in what way is posting a picture of my ID a safer method to get the account deleted than just email verification. 

What I'm suggesting here, is that this feels more like data-gathering than about account security.

Their account verification system is a complete joke, it's easier to fake a picture of an ID, than to hijack an email account on a secure server with two or even 3 factor authentification., I was having trouble uninstalling battle net earlier too.

Brave kid. Add oil., Context: This is a recently widely shared Telegram message in the protest groups. I provided the English translation for ease of sharing.

The Sept 27 rally refers to the San Uk Ling solidarity rally at Edinburgh Place, during which an anonymous protestor recounted that during his stay at the San Uk Ling holding center, he was stripped naked, had his hands and feet tied to a table, and hooded. The police demanded that he ""obey and give up his phone pass code."" He refused, and at least two police officers conducted what he described as ""torture beyond his imagination.""

He believes he was not the only person who was tortured or sexually assaulted. After 30+ hours, he was sent to court but denied a chance to meet with a lawyer. Before that, the police washed his body with antiseptic and water to remove any evidence., This is so bad... children so young treated like this. Man this world sucks sometimes, This is just the people coming forward about it.

We're likely only scratching the surface., I reposted this to teenagers, if you don't mind, These people are so brave. It was hard enough to tell my family I had been raped, I cant imagine telling the whole world. That kind of openness and honestly can never be underestimated., It actually came from a real fb post of the victim, maybe that one would be more credible given that he already does not fear the identity being revealed, This is disturbing., FYI, this has been corrected.

If he doesn't then it's just going to be more rumours that he's been ""suicided"", Add oil, kid., Didn't video come out a couple months ago of HK police tying a man to a table and sexually assaulting him? We know they have a reputation for this kind of thing., Why are you using a partially transparent brush to black out the image?, By now, I still don't understand how mere 50k corrupted enforcers can oppress, coerce, and control 2 million people., So does that mean the cops were gay or was it female cops who did it?

Edit why the fuck are people downvoting it to hell I said it like 3 times it's fucked up 
I was just shocked that there gay ok Jesus Christ, It's hard/impossible to judge if this is real or just heavily exaggerated right? Past molestation by police were recorded as proof but obviously gang raping this teen wouldn't have been caught/released, Highly doubt it. The Chinese had the Nanjing Massacre on them.

But if he was gang raped and sodomized, the first course of action would be to get his injuries on record.  I honestly have a hard time believing a teenage protester wouldn't stand out to point their fingers against the cops with rock solid evidence straight away, but instead needed to wait for someone to set an example and give him the courage.

Blizzard: They cannot destroy China!

Blizzard: Attack!

China: Raise the red flag!

China: Keep the money flowing!

Blizzard: A very good plan.

Blizzard: I build for China., I unsubscribed from WoW because of this., Tried posting this in /r/blizzard but it seems no new posts have been showing up there for the past 45 minutes or so. I wonder if posts are being manually approved?

**Edit:** Started seeing new posts, [mine](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfm5ow/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/) seems to be missing from the new section though., Cowards, Who knew they were a bunch of tankie fucks?, You can only vote with your cash.

A cowling dog rolling around the ground in front of its master., “Our Country”- Fuck em they should boot em out of Cali, How can we in the US post on Weibo?  VPN?  I really want to start spamming the shit out of Chinese forums with Hong Kong supporting Activision characters.

In fact, I know what I'm doing tonight.. I wonder if they'll enjoy Price from Modern Warfare shooting various CCP officials?  

Let's get Activision banned in China., Fuuuuck you Blizzard, FUCK BLIZZARD

FUCK CHINA

FREE HONG KONG, A very positive first step!

And may the autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful., #☒, Just want to say fuck Blizzard!, ""our"" country? According to Wikipedia, Blizzard ""is an American video game developer"". I knew they sold out to China, but I didn't know they sold out that much!, oof., ""defend the pride of our country.""

which country?, This is why letting china buy american companies was never ever cool in my book., i'd say they got some brown on their nose but the truth is closer to some red..., No surprises there., If it wasnt already, now its shameful for sure. What a fucking shame., Okay, that's it for me. I just uninstalled Hearthstone.

That's blizzard., Looks like somebody needs some tegrity...., Did Blizzard just refer to China as ""our country""?, Title is misleading.
This is not an official Blizzard post, this was made by NetEase playhearthstone account., This is an apology? Looks more or less like shitty explanation of the whole situation., This just hurts so much. First and foremost, it hurts because we are seeing a company who came from a country of freedom of speech and liberty clamp down on an individual who wants the same freedom for his country. And on top of that, Blizzard now has stated which side they took: Money and to support a genocidal authoritative government.

On a personal level, Blizzard is what got me into gaming with Diablo 1 and 2. Like most passionate gamers, Blizzard has given us countless memories. And now I have my last memory, one of which the company that has brought so much joy into my life has now filled it with disgust. Fuck Blizzard and fuck TenCent and most importantly fuck you Xi. I stand and support Hong Kong, and will continue to do so so they may have a life of freedom some day., Chinese person here. This post is written by NetEase, they are Activision-Blizzard's publisher in China. Blizzard does not actually write those posts on Weibo. While it is coming from their publisher on the mainland, I wouldn't put a lot of stock in that being the official Blizzard line. Especially the ""defend the pride of our country"" part., Can you share the link to this please? I would like to see it., Let me get this straight,

Blizzard banned the OK hand gesture because some nut jobs on the extreme right and left sides of the political spectrum (both sides totaling less than 1% of the actual population) claimed it was some kind of covert racist signage. They did this to ensure people's rights and freedoms weren't infringed upon. 

Now they are banning people for standing up for an actual issue regarding people's rights and freedoms.... Wow blizz... Give your head a shake, >Our country

Seriously? Not only are they putting China’s pride over American and Hong Kong pride, but they’re seriously referring to China as their country?, Wow. Okay Blizzard. I'm done with you. Fucking disgusting., Funny, this sounds oddly similar to the apology that the NBA made about the situation..., whose country are they talking about? china??, [effacé]]",2019-10-10 03:49:14

> On October 8th, the company issued a yearlong ban to Ng &quot;Blitzchung&quot; Wai Chung, a prominent professional Hearthstone player from Hong Kong, after he said a pro-Hong Kong slogan in a post-game interview.

> After a public outcry, Blizzard reduced the length of the ban by six months and reinstated his prize money - although a week later, the company suspended three college Hearthstone players for six months after they held up a sign that said &quot;Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz&quot; during an official competition stream.

To be fair if you focus specifically on Blizzards earnings for Q3 it shows a downward trend the past four years.

This is Q3 revenue at 9 months for Blizzard only:
* 2016 - 1.767 (legion release)
* 2017 - 1.539 (legion 2nd year)
* 2018 - 1.606 (BFA release)
* 2019 - 1.122 (this year)

You can find all this data here:
https://investor.activision.com/financial-information/quarterly-results

I feel like articles I’ve read been trying to sugar coat things.
* King is relatively consistent on their earnings since 2017. Increases in 2016->2017
* Activision division peaked in 2017 and is in downward trend
* Blizzard has been in a downward trend since 2016

Honestly it would be better to look at this at a full year report than quarterly. But at the very least looking only at Q3 results both activision and blizzard have been losing revenue.

Edit:
People need to look at it as subsidiaries because I believe the revenue of the subsidiary makes a large impact on the pressure the owning company has on them. For tin foil hat, looking at Blizzards revenue over the past 4 years of Q1 thru Q3, it kind of show why we may have saw management changes in Blizzard. Personally I don’t think you can put a price on product quality and customer loyalty, but I suspect the past three years with nothing good / new in the near future had some impact on Blizzards management by their parent company.]",2019-11-08 08:45:08

Support the tweet https://twitter.com/GrundeA/status/1181863334393634816, Anyone who knows anything about Bobby fuckhead Kottick knows that he doesn't give a flying shit about anything but profit. He doesn't have an ounce of humanity left in him. If the predatory in game gambling mechanics being shoved into everything wasn't proof enough, this man has done nothing but devote his life to obtaining profit. His mother once recounted that as a child he would try to make deals with other kids, at one point attempting to sell his mothers ashtray to another child at school. He had business cards made for him at 10 years old or so. 

The dude doesn't give a shit which is why if you Google his name you'll come across many pictures of him with photoshopped devil horns on his head. This man has a net worth of **7 billion.** He can ignore angry memes and letters from a Norwegian parliament member all day.

China should not be able to control society outside of its own walls, yet they have blatantly influenced the behavior of our biggest mass media companies for years.

To be fair, they've done an outstanding job of it. They fund a huge number of film productions. They've bought out our cinema chains and gaming companies. All the while we never once see China portrayed as an enemy.

Games are not permitted to promote LGBT acceptance. Films sometimes bend backwards to include China as a strong and moral ally. These aren't just one-sided impacts of the Great Firewall - China is directly altering the media we create domestically. They're changing the world narrative to enhance their reputation and take power from their enemies. They'll happily fund films that are critical of American history (and even if that's justified, it's terribly one-sided).

And now what was once simply a chilling effect on what types of media could be created has now manifested as proactive enforcement of China's will. How long will it be before China can force westerners it disagrees with out of their jobs? We never imagined something like Blizzard's treatment of Blitzchung would be possible, yet now we're beginning to see how deep China's political tentacles reach.

We have to stop this.

40,Blizzards Vice President - Jeff Kaplan wants blitzchungs suspension removed or reduced. (not all higher ups agree with the suspension),189,dtnymx,https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/11/08/blizzard-vp-overwatch-director-jeff-kaplan-wants-blitzchungs-suspension-reduced-more-or-eliminated/,5,,"[Good on him for speaking up.

I want a statement of apology not the half-apology they did, and a complete rethink of their policies in bending over to get Chinese money.

I.e. Grow some fucking balls and stop sucking CCP cock for money., (article) 

Hearthstone player Ng Wai Chung, better known as blitzchung, remains suspended in the wake of his [live-streamed protest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/08/an-esports-player-spoke-out-support-hong-kong-protests-he-was-suspended-year/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2)  in early October in favor of demonstrators in Hong Kong. That is  despite an apology to fans over the handling of the matter by Blizzard  President J. Allen Brack at the start of the company’s mega-convention,  BlizzCon. In the days since the convention, there are many who feel  Blizzard has not done enough to correct its actions, even after it  reduced the suspension from 12 to six months and returned the winnings  it initially stripped from blitzchung. One of those people is Blizzard  vice president and Overwatch game director Jeff Kaplan.

“I  was relieved when they reduced his suspension,” Kaplan said in a Friday  phone interview. ""And I think the suspension should be reduced more or  eliminated. But that’s just me.”

When Blizzard banned blitzchung there was overwhelming backlash. From [congressional letters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/10/18/activision-blizzard-under-fire-bipartisan-group-congress-members-over-china-relations/?tid=lk_inline_manual_4) to social media posts, politicians, gamers and even prominent [former Blizzard employees](https://www.businessinsider.com/ex-blizzard-game-designer-mark-kern-boycotting-former-employer-2019-10)  voiced their displeasure. Not only did many onlookers deem the  punishment unfair, but there were concerns the studio was favoring its  financial interests in China over free speech.

“I’m  obviously a huge supporter of free speech; it’s something that’s very  important to me,"" Kaplan said. “It got to me personally. I think the  punishment was too harsh and I was greatly relieved when they gave his  money back. I think that was extremely important.""

It  happened “way too quickly,” and came as a shock to Kaplan. He shared  that most of his staff, including himself, didn’t know about the  incident until they saw news articles on the subject. As someone who is  regularly part of the conversation when it comes to handling suspensions  and bans for the Overwatch League, he explained that normally these  decisions are tactfully and thoughtfully considered. 

“We  had to deal with a few of them in season one in particular, and that  process usually takes about four or five days to make the decision,""  Kaplan said. ""There was always a group of us involved in deciding what  the punishment should be, and we would heavily devil’s-advocate every  part of the decision. So I was actually shocked that such a harsh  penalty was levied.”

Brack  told fans last week that Blizzard had indeed made the wrong decision,  but did not rescind or further reduce the punishment. 

“We  moved too quickly in our decision-making, and then, to make matters  worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you,” he said at the time.

Kaplan is not the only Blizzard employee to come forward with his disapproval of how Blizzard handled the controversy. In an [interview with Kotaku](https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/05/hearthstone-developers-wish-blizzard-had-handled-hong-kong-controversy-differently),  Hearthstone game director Ben Lee told the outlet that he believed the  “initial decision was too harsh."" Kaplan is, however, the first Blizzard  head to publicly state that he wants the suspension revoked completely.

Kaplan  made clear he did not speak for the entirety of his Overwatch division,  and said that many on his team of developers have differing opinions on  the situation. 

“I  think as individuals, we all have very different feelings about what  happened in regards to the Hearthstone tournament and blitzchung,""  Kaplan said. ""There is a lot of very different reaction among all of  us.”, paywall]",2019-11-09 08:41:00

42,What Blizzard and the NBA Taught Us,257,dfrzcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfrzcv/what_blizzard_and_the_nba_taught_us/,24,"To fight a giant, we need allies.

Both the NBA and Blizzard incidents gave us inspiration. The US and the free world has been pretty silent about HK all the way till last week. Mostly, it's because they had not had a stake in the game. And the CCP dummies were right there to give them one  --subversion of the American value.

Americans are lazy and like to fight among themselves, until you give them a reason to unite. The new Coke, 9-11, or now, the violation of free speech. The thing is, them Chinese commies have been pretty sneaky about their tactics in the past decade. They infiltrate the American media under the radar, getting hold of the financial stakes of the likes of Activision-Blizzard and Disney.

But just like the 曱甴 that they are, subversive activities collapse under exposure to the light. Let me elaborate on one of the worst mismanagement on CCPs part: After Morey's tweet, the CCP could have tightened the censorship against Twitter, warned the NBA to ""not have it happen again or else"", and swatted down any domestic mentions of the Morey tweet with a heavy hand like they always did. And the whole incident could have been swept under the rug in total silence, and they could have saved a whole lot of busywork domestically and internationally.

BUT THEY DIDN'T! They forced a couple public announcements, Adam Silver, reluctantly, had to side w/ the ""good ol' American value"", and now the Chinese people are likely out of the option of watching the NBA. 

And we should replicate this incident (or dare I call it a surprise win) to many other American industries, particularly Hollywood.

First, let me explain why. China's contemporary culture is total garbage, mostly by its own doing w/ the culture crackdowns. In their own language, 所謂金玉其外，敗絮其中. They rely on the Hollywood imports to fill the spiritual void, after some heavy censorship, of course. Now, imagine a life without Hollywood imports in China. How long can they sustain, when all they have on their cinema screens are the propaganda garbage like 哪吒，我和我的祖國，or 中國機長? We are talking about a 10-year setback culturally. If you wanna break apart a power like China, rousing domestic discontentment should be the first step. And starving its people the cultural consumption might just do the deed, fairly quickly too. For example, not everybody in China is in favor of the NBA ban (https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/2941552). Given proper cultivation, this disagreement could become something stronger and more overt.

Second, let's talk about the feasibility. It's evident that Corporate America will not wittingly abandon China without any provocation. It is A LOT OF MONEY after all. But what the NBA and Blizzard incidents have shown is that when push comes to shove, they can't have both markets. China or American market, one or the other. Then the question is simplified: who is to deliver the ultimatum? Thanks to the ill-management of the CCP, it seems an irrelevant 3rd party player might just suffice. Morey of the the NBA, BlitzChung of the Blizzard Tourney, as we have seen. And Hollywood has no shortage of celebrities who are at odds w/ China. Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford, Sharon Stone, just to name a few (and one can dream maybe one of the Marvel stars covertly hates the Chinese government). At critical public moments like the Oscars, if a figure like them speaks out against China, it might just force the corporate cocksuckers to declare a stance: pro-democracy, or pro-Chinese money. And we then watch the shit storm unveil in China.

So instead of pleading to the politicians to openly oppose the Chinese regime, which they will likely not do at the risk of an all-out conflict, let appeal to our potential Hollywood allies. Write to them, tweet at them, tag them on social media. Wake up the Americans about the Chinese subversion, and force the corporations to make a stance.

TL;DR: if we can't win the fight from outside in, we choke them out from within. Force the American media companies to withdraw, and starve the Chinese culturally and rouse the domestic discontentment.","[Hey, I'm an American and I'm not lazy. I've been following this story for awhile. We have a lot going on over here. An idiot president, a decades long war, police brutality, etc. It really hit home when our constitutional rights were violated when fans at NBA games were being kicked out over speaking for support for HK ***ON OUR OWN TURF.***

Shit just got real, really fast. I support you guys! I'm doing what I can. I'll be boycotting the NBA and deleted my blizzard account tonight.  


Edit: I'd also like to add that you don't hear about this stuff whatsoever from conventional news sources here, and I'm sure that's on purpose. It's not easy for a common American to find out about this whole story., More people need to see this., > Americans are lazy and like to fight among themselves, until you give them a reason to unite.

We fight among ourselves because we're allowed to have our own opinions, regardless of that opinions factual basis. It is in the very founding documents of the country. Discourse and debate have always been a part of America's culture, regardless of the topic. 

Calling the people you want support from an insulting term, no matter the perceived accuracy, will only cause the thinner skinned people to ignore the situation because they got offended. Your proposed strategy hinges on as many people as possible choosing to do something they likely have never done before. Insulting the very people you're asking to act is counter-productive to the goal of spreading the message.

There's another comment here that explains why America hasn't reacted as strongly as you might have expected. We have our own issues with our leaders. For a lot of people they don't have the ability to care about another countries issues when their own countries politics are such a mess. 

Those of us who support Hong Kong in America have done so because we have that extra energy. Larger amounts of people are becoming aware of what is happening in Hong Kong because it is now affecting THEIR country. Or as another comment put it, their turf.

Regarding your actual plan, it holds merit. I've already contacted a large number of public figures about Hong Kong, so more people doing so might force them to address the issue., This is a really good observation. Hopefully more people can see this., Reminder to everyone in Hong Kong: none of this support would have happened if you had complacently accepted the withdrawal of the extradition bill and stopped protesting. These controversies emerged only because of your persistent fighting that has kept Hong Kong in the news. Keep going and 加油!, in your words, you say ""americans are lazy"".  if you expect americans to take your message seriously, don't insult americans.  show respect and gratitude if you want help from americans., Americans being lazy?!  Apparently you haven't heard of [Brian Shaw or Martins Licis](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a759056/5-finalists-to-watch-at-the-2018-worlds-strongest-man/).

A lot of us also support the efforts of Hong Kong here as well.  News Media doesn't check over there much because they are too focused on domestic politics.  A family member of mine was adopted from China, and I think she, and many other foreign-adopted children from the country, are considered as some of the luckiest people in the world as they were given opportunities to experience the freedom of the West that the mass population of China today could only wish to have.  It is events like Hong Kong that will make us drop everything and start throwing hands towards the threat.  When companies start to abuse the system on any playing field, that's when the law knocks on their door.  Because in the present day there is a set of checks and balances that applies to companies accustomed with monopolization,  when it comes to countries monopolizing on companies, we are in a new era of trade scandals, and this is just the beginning.  Instead of John D. Rockafeller, it's Xi Jinping and the PRC.  As a current college student, I would love to see the school organize a civil protest on campus to wear gas masks and hold open umbrellas outside in protest of the violence over in Hong Kong, but we have a significant number of Asian students who are studying abroad, and then the University would have to get involved because some of them could be ""offended."", As a proud American, lol at all these butthurt Americans saying shit along the lines of “Hey, I care!

2. **What are the protests about?**  
Hong Kong is NOT fighting for complete independence from China. The protesters have 5 demands:

   2. A commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality
   3. Retracting the classification of protesters as “rioters”
   4. Amnesty for arrested protesters
   5. Dual universal suffrage, meaning for both the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive
3. **Where can I learn more about the protests?**

Be aware that this sub is the constant target of wumao (CCP paid commenters) so make sure to check people's comment history. They can be subtle and their preferred tactic is to sow doubt and confuse topics, not always face head on.

Also, while you're at it check out the BBC's investigative videos on Xinjiang's concentration camps that are on YouTube, that needs awareness maybe even more than Hong Kong does. Hong Kong has done a great job of international PR, Xinjiang hasn't been so noticed.

Blizzard exactly in the wrong for banning Blitzchung, they acted out in a neutral manner and enforce their own rules. If Blitzchung made a comment saying 'All hail China and punish to all Hong Kongers', he would have been dealt with in exactly the same manner!

Unfortunately for Blizzard, the incident took place on a Livestream for a pretty big tournament and the winner just happened to behave in an unprofessional manner.

Regardless of my personal opinion (because I do support peaceful protesting and the basic human rights and democracy for Hong Kong) I'm not going to let my bias judgement cloud my opinion over what a neutral party should do and in that situation, you either let both sides argue it out, with the Mainland people vocalising their opinions and the Hong Kong supports to vocalise theirs and escalating the debate into a toxic cyber warfare on Blizzard's platform or you neutralise the situation and control the flames as much as possible without adding more fuel to the fire.

I'm not sure if this is a publicity stunt, but even Epic has a clause in their Terms of Service and Code of Conduct and Ingame rules that prohibits the promotion of propogana and the promotion of Religious, Political or Social views on others. Game Developers and CEO's and people who basically don't interact with the community at large or manage their playerbase really don't have much say on the matter as they basically have zero idea of what is going on.

TouTiao is China's biggest news aggregator app, complicit in distributing mass amounts of propaganda and misinformation to its 200 million daily active users each day. TouTiao, along with Tencent news, and Netease News, are all part of the mass state propaganda machine designed to distract the Chinese public from the truth. When they are not delivering propaganda, they are spewing out straight misinformation most of the time. A misinformed population is a population easy to manipulate.

But nobody in the west seems to give a shit about TikTok? Instead, people are circlejerking on Blizzard and NBA, two companies in a long list of corporations who have caved to Chinese demands in the past.

Caving to Chinese demands is the price of doing business in China. I've worked in the past couple of years as a marketing consultant in Mainland China, and you would be hard-pressed to find any foreign company in China who hasn't caved to Chinese demands ever.

The biggest enemies of authoritarianism are not missiles nor tanks, but cars and washing machines. Forcing these companies out of China will only further isolate the Chinese consumers, limiting their options and potentially their entry points to the world outside China. It's the same shit with the Google debacle a couple of years ago - Google wanted to launch a censored version of their search engine in China, but was shouted down by the internet. This WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING FOR THE CHINESE, for people would have another option outside of Baidu, a heavily skewed and censored search engine, and better for promoting the flow of ideas in China.

Seriously, boycott TikTok instead.","[I've already been boycotting TikTok because it's fucking stupid and annoying., Not instead.

I don't want to hit them in the wallet. I just don't want to end up being on a game platform that will censor players who have the 'wrong' political opinions or possibly ban games that acknowledge the existence of certain countries.

Just a random desire., [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent)

I just did a literal copy paste for all the people that want to know what to avoid putting money into if they support Hong Kong. Or say they don't like what Blizzard, NBA and other companies are doing for the monies.**

&#x200B;

While at least two, **CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online,** were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.

Tencent in 2013 increased its stake in Kingsoft Network Technology, a subsidiary of **Kingsoft** Corporation, to 18%. Tencent previously had a 15.68% stake in the company and raised the stake through a US$46.98 million investment.

This is a great thread with tons of references to news articles 

Tldr; Blizzard and NBA community members/player spoke in support of the Hong Kong protest, China did not like that -> Blizzard and NBA censoring and punishing players who speak out, effectively choosing China's money over Hongkongers human rights, Hearthstone player voiced out support for Hong Kong in an interview after winning a tournament match. He got banned from competing for 1 year and had his winnings from that tournament removed. The 2 casters who interviewed him got fired overnight.

Blizzard quickly apologized to China on how the player have offended Chinese people and swore to defend China's dignity and shit.

Caused public outrage and Blizzard decided to give back his winnings and halved the competitive ban. The casters remain fired.

As for NBA, general manager of Houston Rockets Daryl Morey shared a tweet that says ""Stand with Hong Kong, Fight for Freedom"" and China got pissed off and cancelled all the NBA broadcasting events and stuff., What do you mean?   Money talks, simple as that., HK is protesting the CCP (Chinese government) for a multitude of really messed up shit, this started with an extradition bill that would allow the CCP to grab you off the streets of HK and imprison you in China. On top of this, the HK Police force have proven themselves to be puppets for the CCP, beating, shooting, kidnapping, killing protestors. These events have bled into the NBA and esports scene, specifically with the Houston rockets and Blizzard entertainment. This stuff you can find plenty on, especially if you haven't heard the news about LeBron. To wrap it all up, the above mentioned North American organizations/companies have shown the world that the CCP has the ability to censor what we think and say here at home., OP is a troll, no need to waste time explaining what is painfully obvious to anybody who has been paying any sort of attention to HK, Blizzard and/or the NBA.]",2019-10-16 04:36:21

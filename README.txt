Welcome to our seminar's repository ! 

We chose to study the Hong Kong controversies and their impact on foreign countries' reputation. 
To do so, we scrapped the reddit social network in relation with two tech companies : 
	- Apple : a mapping app map used by Hong Kong's protestors to map the repression was withdraw from the App Store (see https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/10/tim-cook-apple-hong-kong-mapping-app-removal). 
	- Blizzard : were an award-winning taiwanese professional game player was fired from Blizzard's prize after 
publicly supporting Hong Kong protestors (see : https://www.pcgamer.com/taiwanese-hearthstone-caster-fired-after-hong-kong-controversy-says-he-still-doesnt-know-why/)


This project led to scrapping both cases (see jupyter notebooks : Apple_case DataAnalysis.ipynb for the Apple case and 
Blizzard_case DataAnalysis.ipynb for the Blizzard case), as well as one powerpoint presentation (Reports/Final_Presentation.pptx) and a 
Seminar Thesis (Report/Seminar_Thesis.pdf). 

Enjoy !

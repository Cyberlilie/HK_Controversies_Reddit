To pick up your badge at registration this year, you’ll need to download the AXS Mobile App. The app displays a QR code (one code for all of your tickets), which changes at regular intervals to help guard against dupes and fraud. Because of that, we won’t be able to accept paper tickets, confirmation emails, or screenshots/photos of the QR code at BlizzCon registration.

After you buy your tickets, you should receive an email from AXS with instructions on how to download the app, or you can download it at any time for iPhone and Android.

If for some reason you find yourself at the show with a dead mobile device or some other unexpected issue preventing you from accessing the app, don’t worry. Just head to the Solutions Desk at registration and they’ll help you out.

Step 2: There is no step 2

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since blizzard merged with A¢tivi$ion, blizzard has gone from the King of game companies, who created games to be known as the best in class, to being ruled by their greedy masters at A¢tivi$ion.  Not only is A¢tivi$ion laying off blizzard employee's to--quote, un-quote cut cost's--, but now look at their game lineup;  Diablo: Ca$hortal,  and specifically Call of Dollar'$ Black Ca$h 4 which i want to touch base on.  

&amp;#x200B;

COD BO 4 cost me 40$ to buy the pack for multiplayer and their BR mode.  The standard edition is 60$ and that doesn't include the 40$ battle pa$$.  There have only been 4 additional maps since COD BO 4 released, or 2 maps every 3 months, when there used to be 4 maps every 3 months.  Also, it's 10$ for 1000 gold coins(MtX) where you can get one face paint and 1 weapon skin(out of 35 weapons).  So basically not only are you paying at least 100$ for the game and battle pa$$, but then, to access the premium character and weapon skins, you have to pay more money to unlock them instead of just grinding or playing well.  

&amp;#x200B;

To say the least, the backlash from the diablo: immortal reveal was well deserved as that was blizzard showing us their now fat faces due to the amount of cash activi$ion is providing them.  Activi$ion is not hands off like some companies(tencent with grinding gear games comes to mind(path of exile)) and it's obvious it is literally killing blizzard from the inside out.  Blizzard has gone from a company that is passionate about their games and community to being a corporate entity that only cares about making cash because that's what activi$on want's.  It's no wonder every blizzard icon(Mike Morhaime/Chris Metzen, to name a few)  left blizzard...it's because they knew that the blizzard they had once loved and knew was gone, so they left.

bogs7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/bogs7h/why_do_people_seem_to_hate_the_blizzard_legend/,1557827275,14,"I get that Blizzard has done a lot to alienate its fans recently, and I would probably be a little bleak with them myself, if I was still an active player. As it is, I stopped playing Blizzard games about 2 years ago, mostly because I feel that the narrative integrity has crumbled, and the games feel less about giving an enjoyable and meaningful experience than about giving something flashy to suck out another wad of cash from me.  
  
That being said, I still have a huge soft spot in my heart for Blizzard, because they were a massive part of my childhood. And when I find merch that both fits my personal aesthetic *and* makes me feel a little nostalgic, I'm quite keen on it.  
  
Which makes me a bit confused about all the hate I see the Blizzard Legend statues are getting. Are people just so angry at Blizzard that they're taking it out on the kind of merch they're producing? Or do the majority of fans just have a totally different aesthetic from me?  
  
I see them being criticised as looking like cheap plastic, being low-quality vinyl figurines, or similar to crummy FunkoPops. And if those really are the real reasons, I think that's a bit shallow, to be honest. I mean, I really dislike FunkoPops (mainly because their prevalence in every damn bit of pop culture right now makes it clear that they're just in it for the money; and also it seems to be this generation's ""fringe investment"" (which is a term that makes me want to shake someone), like Beanie Babies). But I think vinyl figures have the potential of being really cool if the stylisation is right. And I think Blizzard has done the stylisation right, here.  
  
I saw some guys talking about the ""HD"" statues being better, and regarding the cartoony nature of the Legends statues as being an indication of Blizzard's disregard for their fans. Now, I don't particularly like the HD statues (but if you do, great), for the exact opposite reason that I loved Warcraft's aesthetic:  it's very difficult to make things look real, so if you try you will probably fail; it's smarter (in my opinion) to acknowledge your limitations and create a stylised version that evokes the *idea* of the real thing. Warcraft's ""cartoony"", larger-than-life art style was so much more engaging to me than works like Baldur's Gate or Morrowind (both of which I loved, but whose aesthetics I found a bit dull and clunky, because they wanted things to look ""real"" - also, fuck cliff racers). Consequently, I've rarely found any figurines that I actually like the look of, because most of the ones I've been exposed to feel like they try too hard (don't even get me started on the movie-tie-in action figures that try to look like their actors, a la micro Madame Tussauds). The only figurines that I've ever bought for myself are the Disney Infinity ones (just the figs, never bothered with the game). I see the Legend statues in the same light. My only criticism of them is that I would have liked to see a little more stuff on Greymane (he's pretty dull at the moment), and that I wasn't expecting the Footman/Grunt to be in their Reforged styles (hashtag Not My Footman).

Yall are not in the business of making launchers or stores or any of this nonsense, yall make games. I understand yall made the launcher to get all your money, but you suck. Your launcher is pure garbage, it hardly functions. 

Hey assholes, have yall ever heard of a back button? Where is it? Where is the simple button to go back one page? Not there, because yall are idiots. 

Hey fuckheads, ever heard of a refresh button? So when your trash ass launcher doesnt properly load a page, you can press the refresh button to reload the page? No, dont have that either, so I guess, when you go to buy a game and the page doesnt load, you just have to go all the way back to the original shop page and start all over.

Hey fuckin retards, ever heard of a shopping cart? Why in the fuck am I buying Diablo 2 as if it is 2 separate games? The game is 20 years old, I shouldnt have to purchase the full game separately, meaning the LOD expansion, you fucking money grubbing punks, yall are doing that shit on purpose because you are shitty fucking people. Only shitty fucking people would force people to pay for the same thing separately, its one game you fucking assholes, sell it as one game.

Yall are going to crash a once great company into the cesspool yall have spawned from and end up jobless. And you deserve nothing less, yall are absolutely horrible fuckin people. Its not about games, its about being deliberately unfair and exploitative in order to line your own pockets. 

The Diablo mobile game is a perfect example of your pure incompetence. Whoever is in charge of Blizzard right now is a stupid fuckwit, and they are going to cost you all your jobs.

Yall need to get your fucking shit together. Stop being fucking worthless greedy worms and start treating people right. Fix your worthless fuckin launcher and abandon those chinese marketed mobile apps.

The blizzard update agent does not show up in my list of applications to add as an exception to the firewall. In order to fix this, we can go into Menu/Settings/Full Protection/Enhanced Firewall/Packet Rules (see imgur album) you can add a TCP/UDP, In/Out, Allow rule on one or all of the ports that the agent uses. By viewing the logs starting with ""Agent-"" in C:/ProgramData/Battle.net/Agent/Agent.6700/Logs, you can see which port the agent is trying to use. In my case, I noticed that it seemed to flip between three ports: 1120, 6881, and 6882 but that may vary on your system, so you should check your logs and use one of them. I added an exception to only one of the ports, as it seems the agent will try one and swap to another after some undetermined amount of time. When you select TCP/UDP as the protocol for your new rule, fill in the ""Local Port"" column with the port in your log (There will be a line that says ""Agent started on port #6881"" use whatever number it says), and fill in the ""Remote Port"" with 1119, or whatever number following the colon in the line that reads ""Checking Network Connection status to http://us.patch.battle.net:1119/agent"". Filling in the ""network address"" column has no effect, it just gets cleared when you hit OK. I'm not sure if its necessary but after finishing that rule I hit the Move Up button to put it at the top of the list. Now close the Packet Rules window, close and relaunch battle.net and wait a minute and it should refresh and load properly.",Fix for Blizzard Agent Went to sleep when using AVG Antivirus,5,2019-05-27 06:34:52,2019-05-27,0.7556361556053162,0.5

bwpnof,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/bwpnof/im_worried_about_you_classic_gatekeeping/,1559660223,0,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been checking the emotional rollocooter that is Classic WoW as a former Vanilla player. I was pretty upset when I was first not invited, but now I feel worried. I think there have been some kind of survey when selecting Beta Players to create a good balance. I also feel allot more GateKeepers should have been invited.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly as a former Vanilla player, usually I don't believe people claiming they experianced Vanilla as there where not many who played it or got far into the game. Most Players started in either Private Servers, Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King by observation. These people claim Vanilla experianced based on Private Server, but as someone who has 20lvl's private vanilla experiance.. its not the same.. So they don't know all these nuances, how the game felt to play. What feels right and what feels wrong. I think was the most important feedback Blizzard could get about the game. I agree that this was a HUGE Marketing succes and the ammount of free marketing would have been to expensive. So both these toughts where important. However I feel that the game will NOT be tested... and this is a waste, as this is important. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would propose now that the Summer has Started the next Wave of Players is carefully selected with expansive algoritms. And invite people like HeelsVsBabyFace.. As he has represented some of the most loyal players and it would be better than him making Fallout Vids... This was ridiculous. Blizzard is a company that lives at the grace of their Core Players and as I have said in previous posts, these need to be tended to. They ultimately create the desire for the wider group. Money is important, but one needs to invest part of it in order to secure long term sustainability. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the Marketing was exelent.. Game However is not yet tested.. Invite some GateKeepers, GuildMasters, Posters and Other Core Users. Tend to the core user, so you keep profitability.

TLDR: Blizzard NEED to talk more to the costumers and show more info about what is coming, even if it takes a long amount of time.  
We all love this company and its sad to not see anything awesome comes from it anymore.  


I started playing Warcraft 3 when it released and i remember every second that i used to be on the phone with my favorite friend just trading info to help me complete the campaign, by that time i didnt know any english and trusted everything my friend told me about the lore of the game. It was instant love, i loved and actually dreamed about azeroth a ridiculous amount of time throug my childhood. Then came World of Warcraft and almost all my dreams of that game lore came true.  


My friends got into beta and we all shared the same CD to install the game, all the long nights downloading and playing on beta was fu\*\*\*\* awesome, when the game launches i was still in the school so i made a deal with a friend of mine who was a lot older than me to play on his account since i got no money (even so in dolar) to pay and play.  
I got five of his chars into 50s on Vanilla this way, one day i got some money as christimas gift and finally got mine own game, got my Warlock Gwynne to lvl 60 and made almost all vanilla raids by that time and that was awesome (even when i had to farm for months to have an epic mount).  


The point is, we all got time and you guys offered the best games of our lifes but know what we got?  


WoW got his last patch seven months, thats for a paid game is awful lot  
HoTs got left over and all that competitions closed  
Warcraft 3 Reforged got a info with early beta in 2019 and is June without any information, did you guys fired your Social Midia departament?  
Now we got a info that one SC FPS game was cancelled but you guys made a Diablo mobile game even when Diablo 3 got in maintence mode  


We need more info guys, we need to know whats going on and what you guys got, i turned myself inside out to buy your games and your stuff but now it seems that its not worth anymore, i dont even know if anyone from blizzard is going to read that but i was tired of bothering my friends with those things.",A Letter to Blizzard from a Brazilian Fan,2,2019-06-06 23:23:13,2019-06-06,0.5,0.7659509181976318

bxxhto,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/bxxhto/commanders_are_the_future_of_the_starcraft_rts/,1559929401,2,"For starters, I'm a huge Blizzard fan, but I don't much care that the SC FPS game was put on hold. I've been playing RTS games since Command and Conquer gave way to Warcraft 2. I didn't much care for heroes in Warcraft 3, but I think they have their place in Starcraft 3. Currently, SC2 hasn't really had a major update in quite a while, but they continue to add Coop commanders and maps (but not fast enough for the community). And to be honest, these have been the most fun I've had playing SC for a long while. TBH if it weren't for coop, I doubt I'd play it at all any more. 

Ok, so SC2 desperately needs multi-threading support because the end-game of just about any game is extremely laggy... especially when playing co-op with a commander with tons of units like Stukov. Big deal you say? The game is almost 10 years and we should all be happy that we can still play. But still there is no word from Blizzard as to when they may begin development on the next iteration, so the current fans just have to deal with what we've got. 

I don't think they need to re-invent the wheel. Just update the graphics and processor support and give us more commanders. Give us more maps. Give us more to do with the commanders other than just two player coop vs AI. More game modes like never ending waves (defense) and multiple map clearing (offense) modes would be fun. Also, commanders should be able to go head to head either 1on1 or in teams. Sure it may be a lot more difficult to balance 20 commanders for pvp than it was three races, but if anyone could do it, I bet Blizzard could. At least the old Blizzard could. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",Commanders are the future of the Starcraft RTS franchise,2,2019-06-07 19:43:21,2019-06-07,0.5,0.5

After years of playing and loving Blizzard games I've come to the decision that I will no longer be buying any Blizzard products. I truly am sorry as I would love to support the people working at Blizzard, but I cannot in good conscience do so while Activision is still involved. Predatory business practices and a total lack of innovation on Activisions part have absolutely destroyed any interest I had in their products. Alas, Blizzard too is fast becoming a follower in an industry for which it used to write the rules. I know that this is entirely because of the Activision merger. Blizzard is turning into just another corporate brand, a soulless money printer with no care for its IP's or the gamers that play them. Just another garbage publisher in a world full of garbage publishers.

&amp;#x200B;

It breaks my heart to see yet another iconic developer die at the hands of corporate greed, and I never thought it would happen to Blizzard. At least I had hoped it would never happen to Blizzard. Do you guys remember when the only criticism you would hear was, ""whats taking them so damn long!?"" I sure do. Man, those were the days. Now it's nothing but bad press and disconnected business moves indicative of men in suits that have no idea what they're doing. What was once a brand that understood their customers love for their games has become just another PR talking head; saying the right things because that's what companies who care do. I have no idea what Blizzard is anymore. Everything that I am seeing and, everything I am reading leads me to believe that Blizzard doesn't know what they are anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

My hope is that Blizzard will somehow get out from under Activision and start creating worlds again, but in my heart I know that's just a pipe dream. Blizzard is already dead and it's time I was honest with myself about that. So, here is me, with no other choice but to turn my back on the legacy that WE shared. All of us together made Blizzard something truly special to me, and I can honestly say that I have enjoyed every moment of that journey. Unfortunately for me and many others Blizzard has chosen to take another path,and this is a path I will not follow. Activision wishes to do business, so I am doing business by not giving them my money. Rest in peace Blizzard.

I've watched a lot of changes including the transition to the World of Warcraft Blizzard launcher, then to Battle.Net and then further to the Battle.net launcher. I have always been a big fan of trolling in chat in WoW to elicit a response from some of the tightly wound players. I understand that this is a punishable offense and rightfully so. I remember being escorted off the game by Game masters (basically they would just whisper you to tell you to get to a safe spot and then kick you from the game) for chat suspensions. At this point in time you actually were not allowed to log in to WoW at all as during your punishment for bad language/trolling/chat. 

Sometime in the last few years Blizzard has changed their system for issuing social bans so that players can still log in and play their accounts but are severely limited with what they can do in the game socially. For example, you cannot whisper anyone on your Battle.net friends list or anyone in game UNLESS they are in your guild or on your battle.net friends list(you still cannot whisper them via clicking on their battle.net name, you MUST whisper them via in game character chat. You can not talk in any channels except for local Party chat and Raid chat. NOT instance or BG chat. 

I have my issues with this system, primarily that it seems this system is more automated than it used to be and you can be banned simply for multiple unique players right click reporting you but I understand and accept it. I understand Blizzard's reasoning and understand that the game has few GMs any more, and they most likely do not even use the WoW client anymore. The bulk of GMs are just people who respond to tickets. You usually won't even receive a whisper from them in game, you will just receive a notification that your ticket has been answered.

Here is where I take major issue with the Account Silence system: It's Inconsistencies and crossover to other battle.net games. As I described above, this is my experience being issued several WoW account silences. I am punished for my actions on WoW, why does my account silence extend  to other games on the Battle.net launcher that aren't even tied to Blizzard??? 

For example when you are account silenced on WoW you are unable to talk in voice/text chat on Call of Duty: BO4. The same goes for other games on the launcher which are tied to blizzard including Hearthstone, Overwatch, Diablo etc. Now, for the inconsistencies -- On Wow you are unable to talk in instance chats, bg chats, general channels, /say /yell etc. But you are allowed to talk in party/raid chat. On Overwatch you are able to talk in ANY chat channel while account silenced including Match General chat but the ONLY thing you aren't able to do is talk on mic. Even in a private group!!!! You can join ANY group on WoW and talk using the in game voice channels when you are account silenced. This makes ZERO sense. At least make the system consistent. On COD: BO4 you are restricted from typing in any chat channel and you cannot use voice chat. (Why does the ban even carry over to COD its not a Blizzard game and simply has a home on the launcher?....)

Battle.net launcher has taken a new form and seems to be heading in the direction of adding more games including the anticipated Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. It is becoming similar to Ubisoft's Uplay/EA's Origin and even Valve's Steam. This system of banning people for bad language/trolling is a little silly to begin with but it is what it is. To compare this it would be like you joining a server on Team Fortress 2 and being chat banned for trolling/language etc and the ban carrying over to Counter Strike. Or any game on Steamworks. Or being banned from Battlefield 5 and that chat ban carrying over to Apex Legends. It makes zero sense and Blizzard seems to be the only company who handles bans in this manner.

My last major gripe with the system is tied to my last paragraph in that you can't whisper Battle.net friends in game or through the launcher. Again no other game client works this way with bans. Because you are chat banned in one game you are unable to talk to any of your friends on the game client (Battle.net)?? I have people who whisper me all the time on Bnet and I can't respond to them because of the ban. They think I'm just ignoring them but I can't indicate to them that I am banned.

Since then I have spent YEARS playing WoW and even put some real money in the game. Blizzard refuses to change my name on my account to my real one. If I get locked out of my account then I'm royally fucked because they never specified it needed to be my real name.

Their solution to this? ""Make a fresh account using your actual name."" Can you believe that? Their solution to my name being wrong on my battlenet account was to just say fuck it to all my years of playing WoW and start over. Absolute bullshit.

Is there anything I can do to get them to change my name? If not what are some ways I can protect my account from being locked, or get it back if it DOES get locked without showing my ID?

I used to really love Blizz but lately thats wavering. This definitely doesn't help.

SYSTEM INFORMATION
---------------------------
---------------------------
Dell G7 7588 laptop

Windows 10 **Education** v. 1903, build number 18362.175 

Intel i7-8750H CPU @2.2 GHz 

NVidia GTX1060 dedicated video card

-------------------------------

I have been trolling Google and your support forums for solutions and have found several initially promising leads, none of which accomplished anything positive. 

Things I have already tried:
-------------------------------

 * deleting any and all Battle.net and/or Blizzard references from the directories listed on the Blizzard forums (I have taken this step for every applicable possible fix prior to the following items here)
 * Creating a new local Administrator account to install from
 * Checking proxy settings and IE settings for anything amiss
 * Turning off my firewall and antivirus (Windows Defender and Windows firewall are the only ones in use; doing this makes me very nervous and did nothing positive so I'd prefer to avoid doing it again)
 * Making certain the Windows 10 Secondary Logon Service is set to ""Automatic"" and the service is in fact running
 * Varying combinations of all of the above
 * These solutions on my home network *and* my school's network (no difference on either network)

Things I have NOT tried:
-----------------------------

 * Running a 64-bit installer should one be available (I didn't see one but I may have missed it)
 * Port forwarding on my home router
 * Making sure correct ports are open on my home router (which ports does the launcher use?)
 * Attempting the install on a completely different machine (I can in fact try his later on not less than three other home computers I own)
 * Attempting the install using Windows 10 Sandbox (if that works I will try another computer)

Things I *WILL NOT* try:
------------------------------
 * Formatting my SSD and starting over from bare metal

--------------------------------------------

So I need some help here. I don't know where to begin.

Is my version of Windows actually an issue here? Is Windows 10 Education problematic? Note that I actually own this laptop. This is *not* a school laptop, but the upgrade from Home to Education *was* provided free by my school; however, my school has no policy control over it in any way.

Is there a link to an installer that is known to function properly? Please note that I cannot even *begin* the installation and also that the launcher has never been installed on this particular machine. I can't find any actual reason for the launcher to simply refuse to run.

I have two drives; one is a traditional plate drive where I install all of my software and the other is the SSD which holds the OS. Should I be running the installer from the SSD instead of the traditional drive? Why would *that* make a difference if that's the case?","Hello CS reps.

We have seen blizzard create one of the arguably best digital card games “Hearthstone” through its adaptation and polish of former games such as magic the gathering. To me, it seems like a no brainer for them to delve into the Autochess and bring their touch to an awesome game type and possibly add new and exciting mechanics.

If nothing else, Dota started from WC3 and it would be fitting for a Dota mod to now thrive in the WC3 universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago I was playing D2LoD on the new ladder season and connected without deactivating my VPN (didn't even care/realized that). A little bit later every IP that I've ever used to connect bnet was suspended, as per below answer (from the first raised ticket to Blizzard's support team:

&amp;#x200B;

[ No reason mentioned from this GM. ](https://i.redd.it/lleoakdrpd531.jpg)

 

Two days ago I decided to ask some  questions since there's nothing like that mentioned in any User  agreement form, Terms of Use, anything, I've searched every single  possible page,  so another ticket was raised:

&amp;#x200B;

[ Again, I can't believe that this kind of behavior is taking place on the  support page of one of the biggest and greatest game producers:  ](https://i.redd.it/yu47d2gtpd531.jpg)

[ So they've provided two support articles where they're stating that \\""we don't recommend using a VPN\\"".  ](https://i.redd.it/i7nemncwpd531.jpg)

 As I've said in the ticket reply, it's 2019 (and I'm already too old to  be arguing with kinds online) and there are companies that are designing  VPNs in particular for GAMING. Okay, but let's also forget this  aspect... no probs.

Battle.net launcher on PC uses old, ""insecure"" SSL encryption method for the login connection. You could have blocked it if you have hardened your Windows OS, like me. (Group policies: ./Administrative Templates/Network/SSL Configuration Setting/SSL Cipher Suite Order)

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I was writing with support because I could not login using the launcher on PC, but without any issues on Mobile and via Bluestacks. Downloads and updates worked. Just the login wasn't working. We tried everything - which generally condenses into: ""Uninstall all security software you have"". I knew they are not causing this, but I followed through in order to get the script going. Then I had a realization that I caused this, because; I blocked certain old and ""insecure"" (Or less secure than necessary) SSL ciphers using group policies. Those that should have no place in todays networks.

Turns out I'm right and they are using this one: **TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA**

&amp;#x200B;

This is TLS 1.0, using SHA-1 hash algorithm, which has several flaws. SHA-1 has generally been considered ""dead"" since 2017, after Google found it's attack against it.

Just this year a new attack has been found which gives no reason to continue using this hash algorithm anymore. Read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Birthday-Near-Collision\_Attack\_-\_first\_practical\_chosen-prefix\_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Birthday-Near-Collision_Attack_-_first_practical_chosen-prefix_attack) and then [https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/459.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/459.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this not a huge issue. I'm sure it is still taking several years with consumer technology to break encryption of intercepted packets using this new method, but the time is ticking. (At the time Googles attack got published the required computational power was ""6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations"". The new attack is one billion times faster. SHA-1 is truly insecure now.

However, this might still not be a feasible attack against your account (It requiring a MITM attack anyway), but since the maximum password length is 16 character ***for also no technical reason***, both limitations to security could amplify each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Please update to a combination of AES 256 and SHA-2 or SHA-3 with 256 or more bit length. **(TLS 1.3, please)**

I really hope to see this changed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much.

PS: Please use 2FA and a maximum length (16), truly random password. **Security questions should also have a random answer.**","Battle.net launcher on PC uses old, ""insecure"" SSL encryption method for the login connection.",38,2019-06-29 15:31:17,2019-06-29,0.22016793489456177,0.1695660948753357
c6z97o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/c6z97o/i_have_a_question_about_diablo_immortal/,1561816706,29,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I started this thread in hope for a civilized forum to discuss this whole mess around Diablo Immortal. So before I start, I ask you all kindly: if you don't want to discuss about D:I, but you want to just curse all of Blizzard's game devs and their mothers in the thread, please leave now, as I heard those ""reasons"" a lot, how they killed the whole Diablo franchise with only one game, and mobile gaming is not an existent genre in ""serious gaming"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing I can't get my head around is how people still making posts, articles, youtube videos just to hate on Blizzard for releasing (actually not even releasing yet) Diablo: Immortal. I understand the whole disaster which peaked back on BlizzCon 2018, and I share the opinion that the presentation and the reaction from the devs was not the best. You can't tell a booing crowd ""don't you guys have phones?"". That is unacceptable. I am with the haters on that.

&amp;#x200B;

But I have been a Blizzard fanboy since 1997. I loved almost all their games, and I played the shit out of Lost Vikings back in the day. I've seen them releasing World of Warcraft, which popularized the whole MMO genre. I believe, if WoW were releasing nowadays, when internet culture is at this state where we are, it would be crushed by angry fans. How could Warcraft become something different what we are used to? I mean, not an RTS? Fuck you Blizzard.

Noone played Diablo Immortal other than the people who actually played it on BlizzCon last year. And as far as I know, they said it is enjoyable, it is interesting, it doesn't feel clunky. I just want to understand, where does all the fuel comes from when someone still makes a hate post, article or video on D:I.  I am not saying this is the right direction for the series, but I truly believe this is not the direction Blizzard wants to go on. I believe whilst they had some difficulties deciding how should they create Diablo 4 as a new, fresh title in the series, they wanted to give something to fans, while they waiting, maybe increasing their budget by selling a game. Do you think it is a coincidence that the story doesn't go forward, but it is a ""between Dia2 and Dia3"" setting? This is why I don't get all the rage an hate. It is a spinoff title. Blizzard's first spin off title to be real, after WoW, lol.

So can't we trust Blizzard on they will deliver the awesome games and awesome quality they are known for? Do we really have to hate on their upcoming titles so much, it hurts their stock prices? Do we have to kill Blizzard for being innovative, and trying to survive on ""big dog"" scales? 

&amp;#x200B;

Ill keep it short. Got paypal notification the other day about payment to blizzard. But I remember buying something 2 weeks ago, not now. So I am writing to the email that comes with paypal statement for the payment -  paypalFR@blizzard, asking what charge is this. I get email back that the box wont accept my message.

&amp;#x200B;

So I wrote to paypal, asking them, when that payment occured, if it is some late charge or if someone used my account now. They sent back only generated message, that they didnt find any problem and are closing the case. I unloaded little hate their direction that I would welcome little more information and I moved on.

I found another contact on blizzard, I have asked dude there what is going on and he told me it is late charge. I said, okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Week later, paypal for some reason refund me for that thing and blizzard locks my few hundred dollars worth account. I didnt get any refund on my account, but, blizzard says so. I contact them again, explain the whole thing, little bit expecting that they will unlock the account as I have spend a looot of money in so many years with them. Of course not, and that is okay. I said, that fine fine, i dont know where those money went, but I am fine to send you 2 bucks, no issue. And they said, well, minimum you can do is 10 bucks. And I am like..well, it wasnt really my fault, your address at paypal was wrong, I will gladly send the amount back, but dont force me to pay 5times more. I have no use for that money there.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, they replied that it is my fault and blizzard has nothing to do with it and I will buy 10USD credit to cover 2 usd or I will be locked.

The avengers built a multiverse, and smashed everything in two movies. They won millions.

Blizzard makes a MOBA called heroes of the storm. The game isnt successful because (maybe) it got to late.

&amp;#x200B;

But that isnt the end. At least i dont think so. Because...

How would it be an event called ""Zerg swarm"" where you get starcraft skins for your characters in overwatch, diablo and WOW?

How would it be if we had starcraft hero skins and starcraft themed cards in hearthstone?

How it would be if we had PvE in overwatch, diablo 3 and WOW were you have to defend yourself against the zerg?

&amp;#x200B;

It think it would be crazy. Really hard to implement for the devs. But it would pay in the long time, because every time the people starts to get bored of their games, some overwatch, diablo, warcraft of starcraft event would start in all the games, affecting everything at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

The lore is already there, in heroes of the storm. The raven lord is trying to take control of all the ""realms"" inside the dimension of the storm. If he where to screw things up and make portals that connect the universes, every once in a while we could have a demon invasion in overwatch or a protoss expedition in azeroth.

&amp;#x200B;

Сегодня я решил написать вам письмо, так как являюсь вашим фанатом. Мне нравится мир Warcraft, игры «World of Warcraft» и «Hearthstone», разнообразные книги и комиксы по франшизе. Даже фильм 2016 года мне понравился. Однако за последние месяцы я начал испытывать в вас подлинное разочарование. Речь в моём письме пойдёт об игре «Hearthstone».

&amp;#x200B;

Всё началось в феврале 2019 года. Тогда была изменена карта Джайны. Это небольшое изменение показалось мелочью, но после выхода нового обновления стало понятно, что это было начало конца. Я не знаю, по каким причинам, но ваша компания взяла курс на изменение карт в игре «Hearthstone». Прежде всего, изменяются карты женских персонажей. И что ждёт их дальше? На женских персонажей наденут хиджабы? Девушки-геймеры должны будут носить монашескую одежду, приходя на ваши мероприятия? Возможно, я утрирую, однако неизвестно до чего дойдёт эта история. Сейчас вы банально принижаете права женщин, не давая им возможности самовыражаться в одежде.

&amp;#x200B;

Сказанное мною выше – это лишь часть большей проблемы. Своими действиями за последние полгода вы меняете мир «Hearthstone» в худшую сторону. За долгие годы в игре сложилась своя атмосфера, которая нравилась десяткам тысяч фанатов. Огромное множество преданных игроков заходили в игру, чтобы насладиться любимым миром. Но сейчас вы стали переделывать этот мир. Ради чего? Ради кого? Ради тех, кто вашей игрой и миром игры не заинтересован. Вы не стали спрашивать мнения игроков. Не устроили опрос. Вы просто пошли на поводу у других людей. Многие фанаты коллекционировали карты из-за их красоты. Художники старались порадовать фанатов, создавая прекрасные образы. Но вы пренебрегли желаниями всех этих людей, внеся бессмысленные и лишние изменения.

&amp;#x200B;

Я не знаю о том, кто именно был ответственным за принятие финального решения. Я лишь знаю то, что меня, мою жену (которая тоже играет в ваши игры) и моих друзей по игре, разочаровывает курс, которым вы движетесь. За последние полгода я стал реже заходить в «Hearthstone». И после последнего обновления моё желание быть частью этого мира стало ещё меньше.

&amp;#x200B;

Призываю вас остановиться и подумать о том, чего хотят ваши игроки и ваши фанаты!

&amp;#x200B;

(For convenience, I will translate the letter into English. But unfortunately, I'm not very good at it. I'm so sorry.)

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Blizzard!

&amp;#x200B;

Today I decided to write you a letter, because I am your fan. I like the world of Warcraft, games «World of Warcraft» and «Hearthstone», a variety of books and comics franchise. Even the 2016 film I liked. But in recent months I have begun to feel a real disappointment in you. The speech in my letter will be about the game «Hearthstone».

&amp;#x200B;

It all started in February 2019. At that time card Jaina Proudmoore was changed. This small change seemed like a small thing, but after the release of the new update it became clear that it was the beginning of the end. I don't know why, but your company has taken a course to change the cards in the game «Hearthstone». First of all, the cards of female characters are changed. And what awaits them next? Will female characters be forced to wear hijabs? Will female gamers be forced to wear monastic clothes when coming to your events? Perhaps I exaggerate, but it is not known what will come to this story. Now you banal belittle the rights of women, not giving them the opportunity to express themselves in clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

What I said above is only part of the bigger problem. Their actions over the last six months you are changing the world «Hearthstone» in the worst way. Over the years, the game has developed its own atmosphere, which was liked by tens of thousands of fans. A huge number of loyal players come into the game to enjoy your favorite world. But now you're redoing the world. For what? For who? For those who are not interested in your game and the game world. You didn't ask the players for their opinions. You didn't conduct the survey. You just listened to other people. Many fans collected cards because of their beauty. Artists tried to please fans, creating beautiful images. But you ignored the wishes of all these people, making senseless and unnecessary changes.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know who was responsible for the final decision. All I know is that I, my wife (who also plays your games) and my friends in the game are disappointed with the course you are on. Over the past six months, I've been less likely to go to «Hearthstone». And after the last update my desire to be a part of this world became even less.

A couple of weeks ago my 11yo daughter came in hysterical crying. She said that someone accused her of hacking while she was playing Overwatch. First and foremost, she was devastated that someone thought she was cheating. And she was upset that her account was basically shut down for what, we assumed, was a review.

I assumed that Blizzard would look into my daughter’s account and see that she has been playing Overwatch for 2 years, has won and purchased multiple skins, buys loot boxes on occasion, and has worked hard to get up to 530+ level. It’s obvious that she’s not a hacker.

Today I just read an email that said that they CLOSED her account.

To make matters worse, the successes that she has experienced in Overwatch have brought her such joy, especially because she had multiple learning and cognitive disabilities that affect every day life. So for every challenge that she has in real life with going to multiple tutors/specialists, getting taken out of class for special education sessions, taking medications, getting bullied by kids AND adults (!), and struggling to simply keep up with peers ... she always gets to come home and immerse herself in Overwatch. She told me once that when she plays, it’s the only time that she feels in charge, powerful, sure of herself. It’s why she wears all the Overwatch clothes, collects the keychains, dresses up as the characters, and reads the books/comics.

She worked so hard and is so proud of her experience and knowledge of the game. It’s made her more confident in talking with peers and her social skills have improved because she feels confident talking about Overwatch.

Ever since the hacking accusation, my daughter goes online hoping that this is the day that Blizzard will reopen her account.

So to read today that they simply closed it...I don’t know how to even break the news to her.

Does anyone have any suggestions for contacting Blizzard and appealing their review of the account?

Found something interesting while playing a few sessions of Warcraft 1, 2, and 3 the other day...

...I decided that it would be harder/longer, yet more enjoyable to NOT just kill the enemy, but rather let them flourish as long as they DIDN’T attack me. 

So for example, I’d let them build a shipyard, an oil rig, and a tanker, but the second I saw a destroyer show up or a foundry and battleships, I’d send in a swarm of 9-18 subs and battleships to sipe them off the map, then quietly leave without disrupting any of their other progress.

But it got to the point where they just didn’t want to grow at all. They ran out of money, so I had to enter the code for more money, not because I needed it (I had three fortifications around three different mines), but because they just stopped moving unless I did.

Instead of building a transport and setting up shop or an auxiliary at a new mine, they would make 3-4 destroyers and send them almost on a suicide mission towards my entire fleet of 40+ ships...

Does the AI have any “intelligence” programmed in and realize that’s just a suicide mission and a waste of the gold I gave them? Or is it just programmed to attack no matter if they’re outnumbered tenfold? And of course, they made more and more destroyers sending about three at a time, not even doing any damage as my towers and battleships would pick them off before they could get a shot off.

It got to the point where I pulled everything back off their side of the map, gave them MORE money, and they STILL refused to build things that would help them grow like transports for their peasants, aviaries to fly over, or churches for their knights... they just... kept building a handful of ships at a time and sending them over to do god knows what.

So I’ve about given up on the built in AI (as I don’t attack much anymore until my entire town(s) are built up, all the mines and oil wells are dry, all the lumbers gone, etc. etc.) and only defend when I have to, which usually leads to a fairly easy victory as instead of, for example, building up an arsenal of 40 warships like I do, they just send them over as soon as they’re built and lose them almost immediately.

I noticed there’s an alternate “enhanced AI” mod available on the Russian site that may or may not be banned from this sub so I won’t name it. Does that fair any better? What other updates or alternatives are available for any of the series 1-3 that would change the tactics from “attack even if its hopeless and will hurt us in the long run” to a more balanced field.

PS: BattleNet is fine, but not an option (as a lot of times I’m traveling or between work on a private network and can’t log on, so I’ve loaded up my box with single players games.)","Warcraft (REAL RTS Warcraft, not that other thing) AI?

cbrei0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/cbrei0/hero_concept_haywire/,1562820268,2,"Real name: unknown

Age: 20-30

Occupation: wanderer 

Affiliation: none

Base plot - nothing is known of his past as he got it erased by Talon, he has being experimented on since he was abducted at a young age. Talon thought it possible to create superpowered soldiers to work under them and they half succeeded. Their main experiment Dubbed PROJECT: HAYWIRE was given incredibly dangerous electrical powers, so whilst their superpowered experiments were a success Haywire wasn’t the soldier they were expecting. He had actually being waiting until the right moment to break out, and he did. He left the whole place in a power outage and vanished from the experimentation room in a near instant. He now wanders the world in search of his memories and is building up the power to finally get his revenge on Talon.

Basic attacks: Haywire is a hit scan hero who fires electrical Bolts from his hand, the bolts themselves are not long ranged and only hit up to mid ranged. The main function of this attack is that the longer you charge the attack the more damaging it will be, much similar to hanzos. The 
starting Damage will be roughly 30, at max charge it will do 80 damage and the electrical current will go between up to 3 nearby enemies for half the damage (Max charge only).

Ability 1: Haywire dashes forward into a current of electricity, this is his escape and it also does small damage to any enemies he passes through.

Ability 2 - supercharged: this temporarily powers Haywire up taking his other ability off cooldown and making his next basic attack deal extra damage.

Ultimate ability: there are two ideas for this ability, Haywire is immobile for both but also takes 50% less damage whilst immobile.

The 1st is that Haywire charges up the floor around him doing damage every 0.5 secs for 4 secs, the enemies in his vicinity are slowed and cannot use mobility abilities.

The 2nd is Haywire charges up for 2 seconds to then follow up with huge aoe damage of about 400 and a 2 second slow to any survivors in his area.

Unfortunately I have no art of this character as I don’t know any applications to do it on and I’m not exactly the artistic type, however I imagined him to be quite rough looking with short dark messy hair whilst wearing a mixture of different dark cloth and scavenged armour. 

Anyway I hope this gets seen and I’d love any other ideas for him you guys have.  And if you like the concept please share so that it could potential reach a dev.

I have played overwatch since 2017, I loved the game and when my friend decided to get the game for me, I decided to call myself XXXTentacion on it since at the time he was my favorite artist, I really enjoyed his music and at the time I put a lot of hours into the game without having any issues with the given name except from time to time in lobby someone would say lyrics from his song like ""look at me"" or ""Spotlight uh moonlight."" I have them stopped playing for a while due to school work becoming a drag.

A month ago I decided to come back to Overwatch but 1 year ago X, unfortunately, passed away. It was kind of a hard time for me as he was my favorite artist, when I went into a game I forcibly logged off while in a competitive game and I found out my name was removed and I was stuck with ""player"". Why is XXXTentacion an offensive name?

cebfrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/cebfrf/bungie_gone_starcraft_cancelled_now_what/,1563362005,33,"It's no secret that with Bungie having left Activision, a void is left behind that was formerly filled by the Destiny cash-cow franchise. With the Starcraft shooter cancelled that was arguably intended to take over that role, Blizz fans are left wondering what's really next. 

We've also have known for years now that Blizzard has desperately saught the  success it had from 05-11 from it's early WoW numbers, which brings me to my suggestion to the beloved gaming company. 

What is stopping you from making a Starcraft MMO? This title could reinvigorate the entire genre and easily become the new standard. Nobody wants to come back to World of Warcraft and with the rerelease of the Classic experience/the excitement it's evident the title should be on its last legs. Doesn't sound like folks want a sequel or another expac - fact is , you're not ever going to pull those numbers again with that 03' corrolla, no matter how many shiny mounts you offer. 

A Starcraft MMO could not only be refreshing and groundbreaking, but may be the best release from Blizzard of all time if executed properly. In this experience, it would be essential that you could create a character in each faction - but that each faction would for the most part be at war with one another. Overall gameplay/combat would be perfectly fine resembling what Elder Scrolls online has with regard to action elements. Each race/faction would play dramatically differently from one another, perhaps comparable to how Marines, aliens, and predators were in the most recent AVP game from several years back. The largest challenge might be fitting Zerg into many of the traditional MMO elements, like mounts, looting, etc. These kinds of issues have been addressed before in MMOs, and while Tauren in WoW's Beta ultimately didn't receive plainsrunning, it was a viable solution. Surely something better could be done - maybe temporary mutations into mutalisks each of which different skins / types of Zerg could be unlocked / specced into . Loot for the Zerg could also resemble their RTS upgrades . 

The challenges in differentiating each race/faction from one another would be what ultimately makes the game so enormously fub. The unique capabilities and abilities of one race may spill over into characters you have with another - to push players to have at least one character of each type. There could be specific PVE events where all three come together against common enemies, there could be PVP battleground where they all face off against one another. 

Starcraft is one of the most incredible video game IPs out there and it would really be a disservice not to expand it the right way. I long for the day this universe gets an MMORPG and I'm open to hearing any kind of feedback to this idea. As a gamer, I'm beyond bored to death of all the typical safe moves companies make and also tired of watching industry Giants stumble into success with games they never expected to do well. While I love games like overwatch and Apex legends, I want proper iterations of my favorite franchises to take form. A Starcraft MMO done properly could be the only game I'd ever play for many years. I wish this project would be up for consideration at all. I'm happy to hear your comments, feedback, and ideas on this. 

TLDR; Blizzard should genuinely consider working on a Starcraft MMO at this point on time.","Bungie gone, Starcraft Cancelled - now what?",24,2019-07-17 13:13:25,2019-07-17,0.1893724501132965,0.8045937418937683

Hi,

Longtime and dedicated Overwatch player (level 3928 if it's any indication), yesterday, I had the unpleasant surprise to find in my inbox an email notifying me that my Battletag was deemed inappropriate.

The Battletag in question - “RawPLowPLow” - is a phonetic play on the word “Roploplo” (an old french slang term used to describe “breast”, basically unused nowadays and in no way vulgar). Although the gamemaster I talked to when I opened a ticket about it would disagree and say it's a matter of opinion, it is in no way an offensive word. It's a word children can use, and I suspect I was simply a victim of grieving by a disappointed opponent or teammate.

I have been using this nickname for almost a decade, on every gaming service you can think of, without having anyone complaining, including Battlenet. I also interacted with many gamemasters over my gaming years for diverse reasons, and none of them ever complained. I have spent countless hours on Blizzard games (especially Overwatch), and am known to all of my friends as this gamertag. I have grown quite fond of this nickname and would therefore appreciate if I was allowed to use it.

Thanks a lot in advance for your understanding.",A cry for help - moderated Battletag - need visibility and your thoughts,0,2019-07-23 18:25:47,2019-07-23,0.14918148517608643,0.12762343883514404

chepua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/chepua/my_conceptdetailed_blizzard_autochess_more/,1564005571,10,"There are different versions of AutoChess, such as Dota2, LoL, etc., **some players are even making WC3 auto chess right now.**

As a fan of Blizzard games, I have been thinking about an autochess-like game with Blizzard game characters.

My conceptual game will have a **very different and more complex mechanism** for unit upgrade, item acquisition, etc., while retaining the feature of auto fighting and random drawing and rerolling. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I may even start making this as a custom map in WC3. I might as well consider it as a different genre, with the name ""AutoArmy"", instead of ""AutoChess"", as there will be many different mechanisms.**  

&amp;#x200B;

**Main features and differences summary**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Fights**: *each round*, *2 copies of your army* will be placed onto 2 independent battlefileds: PvP and PvE.
   1. PvP: it is the same as other autochess games' PvP, where you fight a random player;
   2. PvE: it is the same as other autochess games' PvE, where you fight neutral monsters; unlike other autochess games, these monsters will be randomly generated. If you lose a round, you will have to fight this same round next time on this PvE field. If you win a round, next PvE will be harder.
2. **Currency**: 2 currencies, Gold and Lumber;
   1. Gold: it is the same as other autochess game, where you gain this currency through winning in PvP, income, streaks. It is used to purchase EXP books that will be randomly rolled at the beginning of each preparation phase.
   2. Lumber: it is gained through killing monsters in PvE. It is used for upgrades, such as Food (unit number limit), armor/attack upgrade, etc.
3. **Unit leveling up**: here you don't combine 3 of the same units to level it up.   
Instead, you feed them EXP books with different types. **Unit level is** **capped** with Commander Hero's level.
4. **Experience books**: these books are what will show up at the beginning of each round's preparation phase, unlike the random chess pieces in other autochess games.   
There will be **various types of EXP books**. For example, 
   1. T1 book (can only be fed into Tier 1 units), 
   2. Undead book (can only be fed into Undead units), 
   3. Fortified book (can only be fed into units with armor type, ""Fortified""), 
   4. Flying book (can only be fed into Flying units), 
   5. Male book (can only be fed into male units), 
   6. etc. 
5. **Commander Hero**: draft a commander Hero before Round 1. All of your units later will benefit (or suffer) from this Hero's stats, including passive skills, equipments, etc.   
Hero skills can be leveled up and heroes can also pick Talents after winning each PvE round.  
For example: Uther. Passive skill: Devotion Aura level1: increase all friendly units' Armor by 1.  
Active skill: Holy Light: heal a random ally's HP by 200.  
Commander Hero can be leveled up by being fed with any EXP books. Then this Hero's skills can be leveled up like in Warcraft 3.  
Commander Heroes have an **Elemental Type**:
   1. (**Earth-**\&gt;Water-&gt;Fire-&gt;Wood-&gt;Wind-&gt;**Earth**), Poison, (Light&lt;-&gt;Dark), 
   2. Units with stronger (""-&gt;"") commander in each parenthesis deal 10% additional damage while receives 10% reduced damage;
   3. Poison type Hero allows their units to have 10% of their damage **dealt** staggered over 10 seconds, and to have 10% of their damage **received** staggered over 10 seconds.
   4. Light Hero's units **deal** 10% **reduced** damage and **take** 10% **reduced** damage from Dark Hero's units.
   5. Elemental Type restricts hero's Talent selection;  

6. **Commander Hero Talents**: after winning each PvE round, you will draft a Talent for your Commander Hero. Different categories of Talents:
   1. (Earth, water, fire, wood, wind), poison, (light, dark), strength, intelligence, agility, attack, defense;
   2. Heroes of the first 5 Elemental Types cannot draft the talents from the category that they are strong against;
   3. poison heroes can draft any Talents;
   4. Light heroes cannot draft dark talents and dark heroes cannot draft light talents.
   5.  strength, intelligence, agility, attack, defense Talents can be drafted by any hero.  

7. **Equipments**: they are purchased instead of dropped. They cost both Gold and Lumber. **They are equipped on your Commander Hero**, instead of on individual units. All your individual units benefit from your Hero's equipments.  

8. **Choosing Units**: draft a race before Round 1. All 15 units (tier1 to tier 5, with 3 units in each tier) from this race will be immediately available. However, **before Round 1, without any Technology upgrade**, you are only allowed to put only 1 unit from each of 5 tiers of your race onto the board.   
Later, with some Tech upgrades, you will be able to use more than 5 units on your board. For example, one Tech upgrade may allow you to have **2 tier 2 units** of your race, with 6 units in total. Another Tech upgrade may allow you to pick a **unit from another race**.  

9. **Units Attributes**:
   1. Attack Type: to certain Armor Types, deals increased/decreased damage (Normal, Pierce, Magic, Chaos, etc.)
   2. Armor Type: from certain Attack Types, receives increased/reduced Damage (Medium, Heavy, Fortified, etc.)
   3. Attack Range: determines the max distance between this unit and the target.
   4. Movement Speed;
   5. Movement Type: may be required to benefit from certain Hero passives, equipments, Hero talents, etc. (On Foot, Flying).
   6. Attack Speed;
   7. Sex:  may be required to benefit from certain Hero passives, equipments, Hero talents, etc. (Male, Female, N/A)
   8. Destruction: determines the amount of damage dealt to the defending player's HP, if this unit survives;
   9. Morale: a chance to strike twice (when with positive Morale); a chance to stun itself (when with negative Morale).
   10. Luck: a chance to Crit (when with positive Luck); a chance to deal half damage (when with negative Luck).
   11. Main Attributes: each unit has 1 main attribute.  
Strength: increases max HP , HP regeneration/sec, Crit Damage.  
Intelligence: increases max MP, MP regeneration/sec, Morale.  
Agility: increases Armor, attack and movement speed, Luck.  
These 3 attributes will provide the above benefits. If one of the attribute is a unit's Main Attribute, this unit will gain Attack damage based on the value of this attribute, in addition to the base benefits of this attribute.  

10. **Units' Skills**: They can be leveled up when the unit is leveled up, like in Warcraft 3.
11. **Unit Synergy**: unlike class perk or racial synergy in autochess, there is **no immediately available synergy among units**. Instead, you choose units based on your desired combination of Commander Hero's skills, units' skills, unit's attribute types, Tech upgrades. You should also draft the EXP books that level up certain units.
12. **Tech Upgrade Blueprints**: costs Lumber and are **drafted in the same preparation phase as EXP books**. For **example**, there will be these upgrades:
   1. On Foot Armor level 1: all units with movement type ""On Foot"", gain 1 Armor;
   2. Tier 1 expansion level 2: allows you to put 2 additional T1 units of your own race on the board;
   3. Tier 4 helper level 5: allows you to put 5 additional T4 units of a different race on the board;
   4. Fortified Morale level 8: all units with the Armor type, ""fortified"", gain 40 Morale;
   5. etc.   
Tech upgrades will cost increasingly more Blueprints as the level goes up.  

13. etc.  

14. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**.

This won't be ""AutoChess"", instead, I shall call it ""AutoArmy"", as it has a much more complex drafting and damage calculation mechanism that may make the game very hard to balance.","My Concept(detailed): Blizzard ""AutoChess"" (more complex mechanism)",11,2019-07-24 23:59:31,2019-07-24,0.9780341982841492,-1.0

Anyway this is a look back at one of Blizzard's sadly neglected (by them, not the fanbase) titles from the mid-90s, and how it has seen a bit of a revival in recent times thanks to various groups of people refusing to let it die.

It's fast-paced, Irish-accented and the game footage is interspaced with intentionally bad MS Paint drawings and ""humour"".

The general channel idea is an alternative to the drier (but excellent) Ancient DOS Games channel from Kris Asick, who is self-admittedly terrible at RTS games.

I've also done a Warcraft: Orcs and Humans review on there too, and two other titles that Silicon and Synapse (aka Blizzard) helped port back in the early days for Interplay (Battle Chess &amp; The Lord of the Rings Volume I).

This is something I've run into again and again with Blizzard's website and I can't be the only one, but somehow it's still like this.

&gt;Your website is frustratingly laggy and unresponsive to use. I've just spent the last 20 minutes trying to get into my own F'ing account just to re-add my authenticator because I HAD to remove it to change it to a new phone (that's a whole other kettle of fish you guys need to fix).

&gt;I'm now in a state where I can't get into my own account to re-add the authenticator because I keep running into the error ""Too many requests received: please try again later.""

&gt;For a start I have SMS protect enabled but somehow email is still the default even though that's SLOWER than SMS? And when I go to the page to try and log in it sends me an email code regardless even if I want to try and get it to send me an SMS, and then when I do get it to SMS the code, it comes up with a freaking CAPTCHA that it then rejects everytime as well as the SMS code? so what's the freaking point of the SMS code?

&gt;So I try and go through the email system and then run into the next issue of there's no way to tell me which one of the 20 codes it's now proceeded to email me in the last 10 minutes is the correct code, so I start trying them and doing various things to try and make sure I'm using the correct code but none of them work and I just run into the error I mentioned in the second paragraph of this cluster**BLEEP**

&gt;Oh not to mention that your fancy ass animations on your buttons.... mean half the time I can't tell whether it's actually registered my press or not... leading me to press the button multiple times thinking nothing has happened.... thus exacerbating the problem AGAIN.

&gt;My suggestions for how to fix this:

&gt;1. Give users the option of how I want to receive the codes by default somewhere in the settings, or at least let us choose it BEFORE SENDING THE CODE!
&gt;2. Add an ID to the code so that if it ends up sending the user multiple codes they have a way of knowing which one is the right one.
&gt;3. Make switching the authenticator a much MUCH more streamlined process.

1. Don’t PGify the gore - They sucked all of the scary out of a franchise that is supposed to be horrific.
2. Allow trading of all items.
3. Create an auction house like Path of Exile.
4. To stop bots, have in your Terms of Use that people must accept before playing the game; “I give permission for my computer processes to be scanned for active programs and agree to this information to be stored anonymously for the purpose of improving the quality of this product. Have a Warden scan for processes and retrieve data that can be used to detect players who use third party software that’s sole purpose is to automate any part of the game. Have a team of people in the company to keep Warden up to date so it can send alerts to moderators when a player is suspected of using automation softwares.
5. Don’t make the game look nicer than the actual gaming experience.
6. Don’t try to be edgy and introduce cool new super awesome deluxe things into the game, the game is the dark side of the bible, everyone has their demons, and this is supposed to be something that will be satisfying to play that simulates the actual difficulty of your demons in real life.
7. Stop trying to make money off people, you’re actually devaluing the dollar by getting money out of people with stupid tactics and tricks, no one on the globe really appreciates it.
8. Don’t try to be popular, just do what you want to do, don’t be a people pleaser, put your foot down on things and stick your neck out so if people don’t like your game they can move on instead of having to ask you to change this and that - stop leading people on essentially.
9. If you have to make it subscription based, DO IT, people can fork out for WoW.. You could also follow the Adobe style and have different subscription packages that cover your different games.

""*F\*\*\* Stan Lee. So what if he’s dead, he’s still a racist thief and an appropriator of culture just like that jerk Cebulski. If I ever work at Marvel I’ll tear down as much of Stan Lee’s so called legacy as possible.*"" -- Alyssa Wong

Given the vile nature of this statement, disparaging a lovely man who created stories enjoyed by billions, the Overwatch forums were overcome with threads being posted. Blizzard is systematically deleting every single one of them. They have learned nothing from Diablo Immortal. The once great Blizzard has lost 50% of its company value in the past year, and it is in no small part due to people like this and policies that cover up for them. Why in the world would Blizzard hire and protect someone who has this level of racial animus and hatred in her being?

I will update this thread as news comes out. My understanding is that if this is posted on the Overwatch subreddit, it will be deleted there as well.

I have been playing the game since it was pretty much released (loved the original DotA map in WC3), but then after a time, I just kind of got tired of it and took a break from it, I just got busy with other things in life (and other games).  I was trying to find a game to get me out of the funk I have been in lately, I've been out of work since March (contract ended), and have only landed a couple of interviews.  I used to go back to my default game to get my mind off things, which was Civilization, but the AI is just really bad, and more frustrating than fun.  So I figured I got back to HotS for a bit.  For a while it was ok, but then I go into a series of really bad toxic groups, and got bullied a couple of times where on player told all the other players to report me (for asking for help with Nova snipping me a couple of times).  Turns out I was put on silence for 3 days, and I didn't so much as get a warning (per their policy).

I filed an appeal, but they canceled it, apparently they decide to uphold it.  The thing that gets me, is the AI tool they use to filter only looks at what you say, and not what other say to you.  If it was looked at in context, it would have been VERY clear I was not been a toxic player, but reacting to it.  But they said that wasn't the case.  I mean when you have your on chat entries that say (excerpt)...

""f#cking help me with Nova dammit""

""Report me for doing what?""

""My mom is dead by the way""

""man, f#ck all off you""

""If I am going to get reported I am not going to help""

""No, I am not going to help that asshole, fuck him, if he is about to die I won't stop it""

""I am reporting him""

The reset I didn't see at that appoint, but other players chimed in for the next 5 minutes saying ""stop it, this is not helping""

If you read in between those line, I think it's fairly clear that I didn't instigate a confrontation, I was only asking for help.  But instead I got ganged up on, and silenced.  We won the match btw, but now I really don't care to play anymore even if my silence was removed.  It's one of the reasons I really don't like interacting with people in general.  I have since deleted my payment information from my blizzard account, they have not only lost a fan, but a customer.  I regret buying those gems just a couple of weeks before.  This is not the Blizzard company I had fallen in love with and admired, they are a hallow corporate shell following their policies even if it breaks the spirit of the fans.

**PvP Progression** 

I've been playing WoW for the past 10 years, my parents got me into the game when i was 9. My sister and I have been playing ever sense. When WoD came out I had to been about 14 or so and that's when i finally managed to get a toon up to max level, I didn't like raiding so i went straight into PvP. Not knowing too much so i didn't get used to my class that much before legion came out, i had my issues with WoD ofc i did, we all did. But at least i was still able to progress in the game doing the thing i liked to do (PvP). When Legion rolled around that's when i started to take the game   
a lot more seriously, i was 17 or so and once i got my toon's up to 110 i started to PvP with my brother a lot, doing 2s and such. And if i'm being 100% honest legion was my all time favorite expansion, i was having more fun then i ever was and i was genuinely excited to get home so i could play. When BfA came out, i was hyped for a few moments, but once i learned that there was a new level cap i wasn't as excited anymore. but thats not the end of it. I lost my PC 2 weeks before the launch of BfA but i didn't really care that i missed it, for some reason the idea of this expansion didn't excite me like Legion or WoD did. and i was gone for a year i only recently just started playing again, i kept on hearing about all this bullshit with the Azerite system and bla bla bla, i only cared about the PvP. In legion i had a lot of fun with the PvP but i wasn't able to progress through it anymore, i was forced to raid (which i really don't like raiding, its not fun) so i joined a raiding guild, got my gear up to 930 and dipped. i figured ""well they're coming out with a PvP themed xpac so it'll be fine"" sure they added a new BG and 2 arenas but they didn't fix the fact that i'm forced to raid in order to progress, and i think that this is at the fault of their decision to remove the vendors. Sense they got rid of the Vendors its been harder for people to progress at all, let alone the PvP progression was fucked too. I don't want to be forced to participate in content i don't want to do in order to progress my character, i would rather progress through the content i enjoy, that's a better way of keeping my sub. 

**Allied Races**

with the recent implications with the allied races i fear that Blizzard wont add any actual new races but instead keep re-skinning the core races and keep them blocked by rep and achievements in order to keep their players busy, don't worry i enjoy the idea of them a lot. but rep grinding isn't my thing. i already know what you're going to say ""well if you want them so bad then you're gonna have to rep grind that's the game"" yea i know, i don't mind not having allied races, the only 2 that i would like would be the orcs and the trolls but that's besides the topic, if they keep adding these allied races it'll just be a moment of laziness, they wouldn't really have to do any real work to make the game more interesting. I would love to see a new ACTUAL race added to the game sometime soon. if you want to keep the players engaged you can't keep repeating the same content over and over again

&amp;#x200B;

**The New Zones**

&amp;#x200B;

Kul'Tiras and Zandalar are magnificent don't get me wrong but you can defiantly tell that they put way more effort into Kul'Tiras than Zandalar. And as a horde player it kinda feels like you're the middle child watching your older brother get all the cool new toys for Christmas. From the cities to the mountains you can tell that there was more effort put into the alliance zones, if you take a look at Zandalar's mountains it just looks like they slapped one texture on them and called it a day, while Kul'Tiras it actually has depth and its does a good job of keeping the players immersed. one thing that i liked about Legion was that the zones where easy to navigate. But with the new zones especially with Zandalar its hard to tell where you are 90% of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Champion(s) of Azeroth**

With BfA's launch came a new level cap, 10 more levels that they want you to mindlessly progress through. And personally that was the main reason why i didn't want to play BfA. I've obviously been leveling for the past few days hoping it would be at least as good as WoD or Legion but its not. i don't really enjoy the characters they introduce you to and none of the story interests me. The story with the horde is just MoP but with female Arthas, and the entire time you play through this new expansion you feel too important. and the charm of wow prior to WoD is that you where just some jackass with a sword, now you're the ""Champion of Azeroth"" what blizzard has done is pretty ironic when you think about it. in their hopes of making your character more special and more unique they've accomplished the opposite. by giving us the ASHBRINGER literally the most idolized sword in the game aside of Frostmorne,  Blizzard wanted us to be the main character, but how are we supposed to be the main character when everyone has the same weapons as you? Magni say's that we're the Champion of Azeroth. but so is everybody else, the charm that WoW had prior to WoD was that you didn't have a major identity, you didn't mean anything, you where expendable. What i loved about WoW was the sense of adventure, how once you hit a certain level, you go off into a new zone with a new story with very little importance. 

I mean its not entirely their fault, you've got to keep raising the stakes to keep the player interested. But once they decided to make us have to ability to build a garrison everything went south in terms of our identity. We're too important, and i don't like that. One of my all time favorite quests is in Redridge mountains, where you have to figure out a way to remove a boulder, so you taunt a giant and almost lose your life as he throws the boulder at you almost killing you, and when you turn the quest in the mayor gives you 10 silver. there was no Gods involved, no crazy ""you're the chosen one"" bullshit, you're just a guy. And i loved that. I really hope they can fix some of these issues, i know players are more concerned with Azerite than the progression of a sweaty PvPer but still. A lot of the things that made the game interesting are gone.

2. Can I buy a ""used"" physical authenticator and attach it to my account?
3. Are there stockpiles of ""fresh"" authenticators that I could get? I looked on ebay and there were only 5 listings, all of which were not in the US.
4. Assuming that I cannot get a physical authenticator, is it feasible to clone/partition a phone operating system onto my PC and access the app in that fashion (importantly, if I do this, is the app going to have access to the other operating system? I could just set the authenticator up on a laptop if necessary)
5. If I set up the app on a computer, is it possible to get banned for it? There will surely be a way to tell that I am going around their intended system.

I ask that, if you are interested, to review this case and evaluate. I checked that I am not breaking any rules in this subreddit but feel free to correct me.

I have been permanently banned almost a year a go after consecutive suspensions. No details were ever given except that I was reported multiple times. In the link is a dump of all the appeals and responses, if any.

Additionally, I paid for an unbanning service and you can tell from the tone of the letters, and I paid for a lot. Some are on the begging side of things honestly that even, to me, hurt my dignity. Some might disagree to that.

Still, if you can, have a look at it with as much unbias as you can. Consider it material that I feel the internet lacks as I haven't seem anything similar to this posted in the past or present.

There can be many takeaways from this:

    Zero Tolerance on Unbanning for Abusive Chat by Blizzard.

    No details are ever given through the appeal system on each suspension and they add up to the permanent ban. The suspensions do not drop with time!

    Unbanning services are useless when it comes to Overwatch. 100% and honestly the letters are fairly weak and generic.

    Blizzard will do everything to prevent you to replace the OW account with a new one on the same Battle.net.

    They are more than happy to allow you to purchase a new account though!!! Double Standards?

    Overwatch is a service and not a product as per Blizzard.

    You can be on the lighter end of Abusive Chat or the most racist, homophobic piece of shit and Blizzard will treat you the same regardless.

    Your Blizzard history as a customer has zero bearing on your ban.

All in all, I'd like to keep this public and on record for future reference. I made mistakes but I do feel that the punishment is harsher than the claimed offenses. Since then, I continue to have Battle.net not installed and have not purchased any Activision Blizzard games or content. I also continue to be unwarned, unsuspended and unbanned in any other online game.

Update: I initially posted this on Overwatch Subreddit but it seems my post got stealth removed?

Something to note: Overwatch continues to suffer Toxicity to this very day.

While I'm aware that Destiny 2 is moving to steam soon (and at this point, god bless), I don't think it's outrageous to want to play a game I've owned for over two years.

I've disabled other start up services.  I've opened up ports in my windows defender firewall, despite the fact I've never ever had to do anything as drastic as that for something like Steam or Origin or even - shudder - the Epic store.

I have not made any explicit changes to my router, or my network connection.  Destiny 2 is a social game that I've enjoyed for 2 years....my internet connection is fine.  I have restarted and reset my router....numerous times.

I've deleted cached files in %PROGRAMDATA%, %TEMP% and %APPDATA%.  I've removed values from my registry.  I've destroyed every single file related to Battle net I could find. 
 I've reinstalled Battlenet again...and again...and again...

I've attempted stopping the download, killing Battle net and the Agent, renaming the folder, restarting the Battle net client and download, then naming the folder back to what it originally was.

I've even reinstalled Windows.  That's right, a fresh install with nothing else but drivers + Battle net.  The issue persists.

**I have submitted a ticket to Blizzard support.**  This post is not necessarily just me asking for assistance (although I'd be a fool to say I'd turn it down).

This is a post is a **warning** to other potential customers - the games you buy on Battle net **may not work**, and Blizzard has done little to solve this issue.  This issue has existed in some form since (at the very least) the launch of Destiny 2: Forsaken, which as of this post was almost a year ago.  A brief glance at other forum posts indicate this issue existed even further back.

As a (decently technologically experienced) customer, **I DO NOT GO THROUGH THESE TROUBLES WHEN USING A COMPETITORS PRODUCT.**

I refuse to purchase a game that requires Battle net until this issue is resolved.

Got blizzard HOTS account warning which I don't understand. Messaged support and got told different lies and then was simply told 'We now consider this matter closed'. Never once addressing my original concern. 

Changed my name and the GM's name, just felt strange to throw them under the bus but if anyone at blizzard wants feel free to look it up yourself 
Ticket Number: US68301362

Blizzard sent me an automated message saying I had a 'non-participation warning' recently. It happened after friday 8/16 when blizzard servers went out in the NE. (see down detector) and it would let me join and start a game and then quickly go 'reconnecting'. I tried twice then stopped and tried later. 

Figuring this was the cause I got annoyed and sent a message off to Blizzard Customer Service:
Me: My account recieved a warning for HOTs non-participation which came due to blizzards servers losing connection and going down for the east coast. I spent 20 minutes -attempting to reconnect- and somehow I get an account warning for this? I am shocked that your actively trying to push users away when there was a wide spread problem. Please let me know if this is the intention or how one earth it is valid to warn my account with no prior history over a failure of blizzards servers. 


I only play Hots and Overwatch recently so the prospect of having my time/money at risk due to a widespread problem and an automated system really annoyed me.  

________________________
This is the First lie/reponse:
Specialist Game Master E--------- here, hope the day's treating you well so far. :)

Connection problems sometimes cause players to drop so we set a threshold for leaving quick play games before you are penalized

Leaving any game in which you play against other people will count towards bumping you in to leaver status. This includes leaving during draft in Hero League, Team League, and Unranked Draft modes.

While you are in leaver status, you will be limited to the versus AI and Quick Match game modes. Your queue times may be longer than normal as you’ll be matched with other leavers until you clear your leaver status. As a leaver, you will see a warning at the top of the game client. Mousing over the warning will show you additional details, as well as the number of games you need to successfully finish to clear your leaver status.

Customer Support cannot restore points lost for leaving a Ranked match.

If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to let us know, and I do hope the rest of your day goes well.


_____________________
So now I am just being lied to and not a single bit of info nor even a seeming vague interest in addressing my concern over the date server outage issue.  So now they are randomly warning me with no recourse and any time/money investment in blizzard games are now at risk. So my wow account(s), my HOTS my Overwatch, my destiny, and hearthstone investments.

I then sent a clearly heated I sent the following:
There is no useful information here at all, you clearly didn't even address the warning. What is this about leaver status? when did i get that? What game did I leave and when?? What on earth are you talking about when you said 'Customer Support Cannot restore points lost for leaving a ranked match' I have never played a ranked match. Are you saying my account has been hacked? has someone been playing ranked matches and leaving them? 

When was this leave you sited? was it during the time where a connection COULD NOT be established due to BLIZZARD SERVER ISSUES. You say there is a threshold for leaves? what on earth leave do i have? I always stay till the end so i am curious as to what on earth leaves and dates. 

If this is simply an automated system with no oversite please let me know so i can cut ties with blizzard and delete my accounts. No reason to risk my money on a product that could be stripped from me due to a bug. 


__________________________________
Now its time for the complete change in the cause for the warning again
Hey there SoRowdy,

I'm Lady Game Master T--------. I hope this message finds you well. It looks like we're concerned with a recent leaver status on your account due to disconnecting. Let's try clearing that up!

Looking at your account here it looks like you got a warning for non participation which is not the same as a ""leaver penalty"". Please refer back to the email that you received for the warning. This warning has nothing to do with you disconnecting from the servers. It has everything to do with the mass number of people that have reported you for not playing, throwing matches, or going AFK after a match starts.

As much as I would love to help ya here I'd suggest trying to contribute more while you are playing to prevent this kind of thing from happening again. I hope this information helps. If you have any other concerns please feel free to reach out.

-T--------


________________________________________
So Now i am no longer a leaver but its just that I was reported a bunch even though first reponse was 'You are in the leaver queue now: 
Seeing as i have a VOD of about 2 - 2 1/2 months of games I once again am left with nothing more than 'shucks the system sure said things'. HOTs has a history of people spamming reports for games they lose simply because of how toxic it has become. I would be more than happy to waste time watching games with you, while i am not at all good at HOTS i do not ever intentionally throw, nor do i go AFK after a match starts. 

But you still haven't answered two of my key questions so i will simply copy paste them:

 What on earth are you talking about when you said 'Customer Support Cannot restore points lost for leaving a ranked match' I have never played a ranked match. Are you saying my account has been hacked? has someone been playing ranked matches and leaving them? 

when did i get that? What game did I get reported for and why, what was my K:D compared to others, waht was my contribution. I mean clearly you are just having an automated system do this and no one is actually reviewing these, i am simply asking for someone to spend more than 5 seconds to verify this. 


-SoRowdy

Then the final proof that they really don't care is the reponse:
Hey there Jeff, 

Game Master U-------- here to help you out. Thanks for taking the time to contact me today. 

I hear you had some questions about a warning that you recently received in Heroes of the Storm.

I checked into your account data, and I wanted to clarify a few things. 

This detection came from our system and the warning was put in place based on that detection, this did not come from reports from other players. We included all of the details that we are going to disclose in the email that was sent to you. If you have any questions, please refer to that email for details. 

We now consider this matter closed and would not look to enter into further discussion on the subject.

Have a good day



So if you can't tell I am beyond annoyed with this interaction and still have no idea if they are at all related to the day when blizzard had connection issues.

So now when i tried to use my email account, it says email (account) doesn't exist and i was able to create a brand new account with the SAME email address that had tons of content yesterday. and guess what, there is nothing on it.

Yesterday i submitted a ticket that my 2nd account(my email)was hacked in July, where the hacker changed my security question my password and email. And the reply i got from costumer service was so infuriating. 
Howdy,

This is Ritorack - thanks so much for taking the time to write to us about wanting to recover a World of Warcraft account. I found it but it has been in use by some other user for several years now. :/

Up front, I don't have the best news to share. Due to the amount of time and investment that this new person has made, we no longer consider it to be recoverable anymore and we will leave it as is. If you'd like to return to play World of Warcraft then please create a new Blizzard account and attach a new WOW game to it with a paid subscription.

I know this isn't the answer you're looking for but I appreciate you taking the time to read my response. If you have any other questions or concerns, please let us know.

Sincerely,

Specialist Game Master Ritorack

Greetings Osi!

Game Master Crahomin here and I will be helping you out today! First off, thank you for your patience while we got to your ticket ^_^ 

After reading over your ticket, I understand you would like to get a battle.net account back.

Just like the last Game Master I do not have the best news. Looking into it they have made the right call. We can not provide you with access into this account since it is officially theirs now.

Thank you again for taking your time and getting in touch with us about this. Have a good rest of your day!

Hey Osi, Game Master Rahacoatl here.

Thank you for your patience for waiting on a response and contacting us about the status of an account.

I did some digging into the situation, and the investigation yielded the same results as the previous Game Masters have stated, the account appears to belong to another individual, and as such, we're unable to discuss the status of an account with anyone but the account holder.

Thanks for taking the time to contact us Osi ! If you have any other questions or concerns, please contact us again in the future!


my latest reply was 
Can i have the reason why you are giving it to the hacker, at the very least. the first GM said because it was used by him for a long time a month or two isn't a long time, so why am i losing my account???? is it a company policy to side with hackers vs your long time costumers????? it was taken on the 15th of July last month, my brother last log in was two and half months ago so till two and half months ago my brother was playing on the account almost daily. this makes zero sense, at the very least you can be clear with me why am i losing my account. the replies i m getting are more and more ambiguous.

There are so many things that makes them special but even if you choose to ignore that and focus on the mistakes they have made, you would have to be a liar to not admit that there is something organic and magical in their creations.

For me, the playful and almost childlike animations is what does it. I absolutely love their fun proportions and colorful worlds while taking on deep stories. 

World of Warcraft is the best MMORPG that has existed so far. Adventuring in Azeroth is a magical experience. Sure, flawed at times, but magical at its heart. 

Overwatch is the best shooter I have ever played. Again, the colorful animations are a big part of it being amazing for me and I am sure for other people too. But the smooth satisfying shooting and movement is just so pleasant and amazing that you can tell Blizzard have done extensive research on what makes a shooter satisfying and most importantly, fun.   

What I am trying to do is urge you to keep being supportive and focus on the good. Because for sure, it outweighs the bad. Be critical, that helps the games become better. But don’t feed on it. 

Just think about this for a moment, Blizzard have created the best games of all time within certain genres. Even though I don’t believe in genres, I say this to emphasize the point. They are an amazing company. One of the very few, if not the only one, that is still organic and do things out of love and passion.

So what is our goal? Our goal is to educate new players, while providing a place for old players to discuss new strategies. This is the mindset that we ask each of our new members to take on as they enter our server. We also ask that you look out to your struggling fellow gamers and ask them to join our discord so we may grow our community, and provide a resource that others can use again and again.

Basically we are looking for people to better expand our young community who are skilled, and want to provide others with advise, or those who are not yet skilled and may need advice.

Backstory:

Yesterday at 3 a.m, as I was falling asleep, I got an email from Blizzard saying that a login attempt had been made. Obviously this wasn't me, so I set up my phone number to be able to verify myself if anything were to happen and I downloaded Blizzards Two-Factor Authentication app. The app works by just asking if I want to allow a person in whenever someone logs in. I felt comfortable having that Two-Factor Authentication set up meaning nobody could get in, even with my password. With that, I went to sleep.

Fast forward to 8 a.m, I woke up with a request from the blizzard authentication app saying ""Russian World Federation wants access to my account"". I quickly click on the notification but when the app opens there was no request. I immediately figured that the request had expired, meaning they tried to log in a while ago. I then notice I have a new email delivered at 5 a.m explaining how my blizzard account password had been changed. I was shocked and quickly used my phone to verify myself and change my password. This wasn't a password I use for major accounts but I use it often. I decided to change all passwords for my major accounts, my dad suggested LastPass which helped me make better passwords. They had access for two hours and as far as I know, nothing has changed.

Question:

Does anybody know how they could have accessed my account even with Two-Factor Authentication? What could they have accessed through my Blizzard account? I really just want to talk to a representative and find out how they bypassed 2FA.",How did my account get hacked even with 2FA,0,2019-09-20 16:49:51,2019-09-20,0.11966219544410706,0.1635151207447052

Hey, guys! just posting the [forum thread](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/cant-connect-to-battle-net/89664/32), as it's kind of hard to find. Several countries are having issues with connecting to *anything* Blizzard europe, including the site and the forums. This obviously includes the launcher and *all* games.

There  hasn't been any official acknowledgement of the problem yet, and since a  lot of people can't even log in the forums, they are posting on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1176775252363436032). It looks like several countries are affected, and specific ISPs in each country.  it's been half a day so far.

The countries and ISPs reported so far in the forums are:

* Greece - Wind.
* Lithuania - Telia.
* Bulgaria - A1.
* Ukraine -  IT Technology.

On twitter there are mentions including more countries and ISPs such as:

* Denmark - Telia.
* Hungary - ISP not mentioned.
* Belgium - ISP not mentioned.

Go to the [forum thread](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/cant-connect-to-battle-net/89664/32) and respond to the blue post to report the problem if you're experiencing it.

A Moon over the Vale shines  
Casting its glow upon the jungle  
Where proud Warriors heed the call  
To defend our Nation and sacred grounds.  


A Moon over the Vale shines  
Far above the cries of battle  
Where blood is spilled  
Of foe and comrade alike.   


And when our brethren pass  
Into realms beyond the known  
The soul-spirit hardens  
Deep beneath the Vale.

My girlfriend got this shirt for herself last year. The order was sent out but then at some point, it was stuck. The tracking just wasn't moving. So after a few weeks of wait, we contacted blizzard and they told us to contact FedEx about it. So we did that. They told us that too much time had passed and that they didn't have any information left about the package. 

We waited a few more weeks (which was a mistake).

We contacted blizzard again and now got told that too much time had passed (30 days is max) and that they won't resend it.

So no money and no ordered product. 

I know it would still mean the world to her, to get that shirt and so I'm looking for someone, to sell me theirs (preferably female size m), so I can surprise her with it.

Good Morning, 

I was just curious as to what happened to blizzard? How much money would we need to raise to get you off of China's funds? Banning a esports player for supporting Hong Kong is by far the most disgusting action this company has done and you guys partnered with Activision!! As a company you make a weak claim that you are protecting your image by attempting to silence this person, however in doing so you have proven your real opinion. Blizzard cares more about profit then about the freedom the people there are fighting for. Shame on this company. I know it's not much for one person to stop playing anything related to blizzard but I'll be doing so and encouraging my friends to do the same. Perhaps you have missed the video's of emergency services in tears because they are being physically blocked from assisting protesters, or the video of children as young as 10 being arrested. How about the videos of peaceful protesters being shot in the face with bags and losing their eyes? How much is their eye worth blizzard?  Maybe you've missed the news where they've banned masks in an attempt to arrest more people. Maybe you've missed the recent news that protesters have been shot with real ammunition now versus the bags. I'm glad you are in America where you can openly run your business with no issues of the government ever limiting your freedoms. I hope your office is nice and cozy while these people fight for their freedom. You've made your opinion clear blizzard.

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn).

Deleted all Blizzard / Activision games off of my computer and uninstalled Battle.net. I have combed my steam library and have uninstalled all Activision published games I had installed:

Call of Duty: Black Ops III
Prototype
Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved

I don't think I will ever touch a Blizzard or Activision game again in my life after this. Been playing Blizzard games since Brood War in the 90's. The cat and mouse custom game was the first PC gaming experience I remember having. Writing this hurts deeply but I know I'm making the right decision. Supporting communist China is not something I wish to be complicit with and continuing to play Blizzard/Activision games now leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I cannot think of anything the company can say or do to remedy this situation as they've just spit in HK's and everyone who supports democracy's face. There is no apology that I will accept. Signing off Battle.net for good, FUCK CHINA, FREE HONG KONG, peace out.

Edit: Also doing some research on other US companies Tencent has a stake in (Chinese company who apparently controls Blizzard/Activision now) I found:

Snapchat
Tesla Motors
Glu Mobile

Guess my hopes of ever buying a Tesla are now out the door as long as they remain investors. Also deleting my Snapchat account too.

Edit2: Tencent has also invested 150+ million into Reddit. Fuck. Well I guess I'll keep my account here so I can continue to say FUCK CHINA! Xi Jinping is a fat ass blood thirsty dictator that looks like Winnie-the-Pooh. Also:

&amp;#x200B;

I have been a fan ever since I played the Warcraft II demo when I was 11. I remember clearly installing it from a demo disc included with a game magazine, and I fell in love with your company ever since.

The WCII Battle Chest edition was the first video game I ever bought with my own money, that I painstakingly saved up for doing chores for my parents. 

Then I discovered Starcraft, and spent years failing, but enjoying my time as a Zerg cerebrate.

Warcraft III was our go-to game at every LAN party.  Tower Defence and DOTA mods, hours on end. Not to mention the wonderfully crafted campaign.

Then you announced World of Warcraft, I was so overjoyed when I got that mail to join the beta, and for years after I played it religiously. It cost me a year of my life because I prioritized it over school, but I had little regrets because I was playing an IP and a game I truly adored, with friends none the less. Then SCII, I was so proud the first time I hit Gold ranking. Then Diablo III, some Overwatch, and to date I think I've bought cards for every single Hearthstone expansion you've released, even though I mostly just enjoy the single player adventure.

Today however, my heart was broken. I don't understand why, I presume the Chinese market is just too big for you not to appease them, but you have openly chosen to politically endorse an evil regime, a regime that is actively suppressing democracy in Hong Kong.

You didn't have to do anything. You could have let the Hearststone player give his message and simply chose to ignore it. Instead, you have decided to take an active political stance.

It pains me that I can no longer buy any of your products. I hope  you will change your stance, and support the people of Hong Kong. I would have never expected you to do that, had you not done what you have done. It's disgraceful. Please change your ways and become a force of good in the world again.","I was a fan for 24 years Blizzard.

If you have been keeping up with current events lately, there has been a lot of discussion about a recent controversy regarding Blizzard and Blitzchung, a banned Hearthstone player. You can read more about it [here.](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23179289)

During times of controversy, /r/Blizzard gets a sizable influx of users and posts as you may remember from last Blizzcon. This comes with a lot of spam, rule-breaking, off-topic, and low-effort content. At the same time, we take great care to avoid censoring sensible discussion. As such, all discussions relating to the aforementioned situation will go in this megathread for now.

**It should go without saying that any witch-hunting, doxxing, and personal threats are against site rules and are still bannable offenses. We are grateful for all our decent users, and everyone who reports rule-breaking posts/comments.**


*Finally, a note on the short time the subreddit was private:* For some reason, one of our recent mods set the subreddit to private then deleted his account. It was an odd event, but rest assured, us remaining mods have restored it to public. No, we were not contacted by Blizzard, nor are we employees to any extent. We are committed to supporting this community. Thanks!

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn).

Everywhere I look, I only see posts and articles berating Blizzard about the decision they made. I for one, am supporting blizzard. Let me explain:

1. There are rules for these kinds of competitions. It is explicitly stated that no statements that could cause reputational damage to Blizzard are allowed. This, to me, is completely fair game. The only thing that would have been better is if they had made another rule stating no statements of political nature are allowed.

2. All these people who claim they uninstalled battle.net and unsubbed from w/e game Blizzard made need to gtfo. Image genuinely enjoying WoW/Overwatch etc. and unsubbing/de-installing because of Blizzard's reaction to a pro-player's political statement on something that is happening very far from your own bed. Get your head out of your ass, you will keep playing if you enjoy doing so. What is happening in Hong Kong is terrible, and I fully support the protesters, but consider my next point;

3. Activision-Blizzard is a company, a big US-based company even. In my general understanding, any game companies such as Blizzard would have 2 major goals, and I'm sure there is more. First is making games and trying to be good at it. Second is company growth. Every single company on this earth knows there is money to be made in China, no matter their regime or views. Blizzard has a gigantic audience in China. The last thing Blizzard would want is facing Chinese Censorship and no one in China being able to play any Blizzard games, which is very understable since it completely undermines a very important goal, which is company growth.

A pro Hearthstone player made a political statement supporting the HK protesters, there is nothing wrong with that. But Blizzard's response is not wrong either. People keep pretending this is a perfect world, where anyone could do or say anything they want without any repercussions, where companies are not money-focussed, where countries and goverments are fair and diplomatic. Listen, this is not that world. If it were, would there even be demonstrations in HK? Would China be as totalitarian as it is? Would Trump be president? Would humanity not be destroying the planet that gave birth to them? 

This world is flawed, you are flawed, I am flawed. Humanity is flawed. There is a bunch of shit happening in the world that you can do absolutely nothing about. I care a lot for this planet and it's inhabitants, but I know where to draw the line for myself. I will keep playing Blizzard's games, because that is what I enjoy and I will keep supporting Blizzard. Blizzard is not one person. Blizzard is a company with many many divisions, with many people working for them. Stop acting like Blizzard is the kid on the playground who punched the kid that was trying to stand up for another kid getting bullied, that is not how it works.

For those that want to boycot Blizzard, all the more power to you. All I know is that if the amount of energy people put into shit like this would be put into ways to better the planet or humanity as a whole, damn, shit might actually change. That being said, I fully support the Hong Kong protesters and I hope it will come to a peaceful end soon.",I will stand up for Blizzard,0,2019-10-08 23:48:18,2019-10-08,0.8818440437316895,0.7830337285995483

When I was a kid, I played 3 games. Descent, Diablo, and Starcraft. Blizzard defined my gaming life for the next decade, and once SC2 was released, I worked hard to reach masters. I played in tournaments. I hung out with people on twitch and discord. I poured cash into the heroes. Same thing with Overwatch. Worked my way up to diamond, despite 60 hour weeks, and OW loot boxes were my go to gifts for friends who gamed.   


You'll never see another penny of mine, unless this nonsense is completely rescinded.   


I've unsubbed from SC and OW channels on twitch. I've uninstalled all blizz games, as well as the launcher. You'll not get my views again on WCS, or any other tourney. Which sucks, because you've betrayed a pretty big community, but this isn't something I can compromise on.   


One of my earlier jobs was to work with students who traveled to the states from Hong Kong. I would have stood with them on principle regardless, but because of this experience, I also stand with them in passion. These sorts of betrayals burn deep inside, and I promise you this fire will not go out.

I’m between those half hours is play Warcraft, the rts. Since that time I picked up nearly every Blizzard title that’s been published.

I now have 3 kids. I’ve played WoW with them. I’ve played Diablo with them. I’ve played Overwatch with them.

Today I told them we’d no longer be playing any of these games in the future. My middle child is a huge Overwatch fan. They broke down and cried because we have a lot of bonding time playing it.

So then I explained why. I explained that the Chinese Government is extremely evil, and then gave a few historical moments in time when the voice of the people around the world had to reach such a fevered pitch that that criminal country had to stop doing what it was doing or suffer the consequences.

I explained that the Chinese government doesn’t allow you to be critical of its horrific decisions.

I explained that China is killing thousands of minorities.

I then explained that companies like Blizzard are more concerned with money than the rights of humans that they are willing to impose the silence that China wants , since they are financial investors.

After that those lessons in history and dictatorships this kid totally got it. They asked since  we wouldn’t spend money on these games could we use that money to support the people in Hong Kong.

As a father, that brought a tear to my instantly. I have a young teenager able to understand the gravity of the situation going on over seas and here we have a god damn company more concerned with their already generous bottom line than they are about human lives.

df70o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/df70o3/why_blizzard_should_embrace_overwatch_porn_rather/,1570571778,3,"Pornographic content based off of video games is nothing new. Ever since the birth of the internet, it has been the home of porn and it is debatable, that over half of the content on the internet is pornographic material. Since the internet is such a large place and a place to share creations, there was no doubt that people would be posting porn based off their favorite characters in video games. That's the whole reason why this subreddit even exists! This makes it more and more confusing to me, why Blizzard is taking down Overwatch porn.

Overwatch is a perfect example of a game that can be put into erotic fan art and SFM porn animations. The characters of Overwatch strike such a balance between cartoon and realism, they make for perfect targets for the home of porn. Especially since a good amount of the female characters of the game are usually in sexy, skin-tight outfits. There is also no way the character designers designed Widowmaker thinking she would not be put in these animations. They also strike a perfect compromise between cute and sexy (Ex. D.va, Tracer) on top of the fact they have fantastic models and are animated beautifully. Their personalities can also attest to the fact of why they are so attractive to people. But that's just the characters and why they fit perfectly into porn.

The artists are also a big reason for the popularity of Overwatch porn. While, when these SFM are animations are bad, they are really bad, but when they are good, they are overwhelmingly good. You can tell that these artists are putting their heart and soul into these creations. The quality of these animations is borderline perfect. One of the best examples of these kinds of animations is this one that was created by ozzysfm, features D.va having sex with an unknown man. You can see the effort that has been put into this post. D.va's facial animations are perfect, and you can see how she's felling just by looking at her face. The way her boobs bounce and how her butt jiggles also helps in showing how talented people are. Sound is also a great addition to the sexiness of these animations. While a majority of the SFM animations don't have sound, and at points it can be frustrating looking at an amazingly animated video without sound, it is also great when they do have it. This animation created by ellowas features Widowmaker and Hanzo having sex. This animation has two different versions, one silent and one with sound. Sexy right? Models are great, animation is smooth, her boobs bounce beautifully, and when Hanzo slaps Widowmaker's butt, awesome. You see how much more that ads to the video? So much sexier. Her moans are awesome, and the butt slap now has a slap sound! The animations usually consist of short, looped videos with no plot and is only focused on being arousing. That works fine, but some take it a step further with introducing plot elements into the mix, almost like a porno. These can not only be intriguing and sexy, but also touching and romantic. One such example is of this two and a half minute video titled ""The Valentine"" made by nyl2 which is a lesbian love story between Mercy and Pharah. You can see that the voice acting is not on par with the one with Widowmaker and the animation not as smooth as the one with D.va, the effort was put into the plot and little details such as how the police lights reflect off of the wine glasses. You could argue, the story isn't that impressive, it's at least something with thought put into it. But why am I telling you this? (Other than the fact I can't post this anywhere else with non Overwatch porn fans because it's NSFW) All of these are reasons of why Blizzard should (not publicly) embrace Overwatch porn.

What I's saying is that with all of the effort fans put into their creations, at the end of the day, it's fan art. Effort has been put in to make fan art and taking them down will take all of these creators effort down as well. Blizzard said they were taking them down because Overwatch is a game targeted at people of all ages. Including kids. They said that kids should be subjected to this sort of exposure, but kids are discovering porn at younger ages now thanks to the internet. What's the difference if a kid sees live action porn and Overwatch porn. If kids like Overwatch, they will spend their time playing Overwatch. Not looking up porn of it! With all of the porn on the internet, how likely is it that they would just stumble upon Overwatch porn? I think it's because they want to protect their IP, but none of the artists are charging money to have these animations be seen. If they have a patron, the patron will only get to see the art early. At the end of the day, it's fan art and people should have the right to put the effort to create something that they are only showing support and love towards. Hell, some viewers of Overwatch porn might even by the game because they are interested. If you can, spread this message where you can. I'd really appreciate it, and I think Overwatch porn artists would as well. Or don't. You don't have to. If you disagree with my opinion, that doesn't mean your not a great person.","Why Blizzard should embrace Overwatch porn, rather than reject it",20,2019-10-08 23:56:18,2019-10-08,0.09165289998054504,-1.0

The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件, liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.","Blizzard, why kowtow to an oppressive regime?",10,2019-10-08 23:59:43,2019-10-08,0.006164342164993286,0.5

df72rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/df72rl/games_should_remain_free_of_politics/,1570572014,10,"Distancing  yourself from political statements =/= being against those political  statements. Blizzard has participated in many diversity programmes,  charities and the likes to show they **DO** care about humanitarian causes.

&amp;#x200B;

Blizzard is **NOT**  a non-profit company, thus distancing yourself from a call for a revolution,  that often goes hand-in-hand with violence and people getting hurt on both sides is the safest choice to make as a company. That doesn't mean they don't care about what's happening in  Hong Kong, but people see Blizzard following up on the terms in the  contract that Blitzchung signed, as proof that they **supposedly** don't.  


This  revolution may last for months or years to come, but Blizzard allowing political statements such as these will have a  long-term **irreversible**  effect on their ability to sell their products in China no matter which side wins or loses in the end.   


The loss of  this market can be the downfall for Blizzard games as China stands  for about 25%+ of the worldwide (mobile) gaming market. Losing this  market will result in games being cancelled, developers being fired,  (future) games or expansions to existing games to not be produced or of lower quality.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I don't want a  gaming company to take **ANY** stance in political affairs at all, as this opens up opportunities of said company to influence people's views. A company taking a stance only stands to lose as there will always be people that support or oppose that cause.

&amp;#x200B;

We have media-outlets, network television and influencers spoon-feed their views upon us, the western media in general has a negative bias towards anything China-related(Especially in the US), a prime example being the Chinese government mass-surveillance programme even when western countries are implementing mass-surveillance systems as we speak but that gets little to no attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Games should remain free of anything political as it's a means to escape real world dread and shouldn't be used as a tool to influence whichever side of the coin the Gaming company sides on.",Games should remain free of politics,0,2019-10-09 00:00:14,2019-10-09,0.8996098041534424,0.5

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.

Looking at 25 years of trajectory, they have fallen so far, and it is such a waste. Waste of potential, waste of talent.

With benefit of hindsight, I think WoW's success was actively a curse on the company... it changed the culture, it changed the priorities. Since WoW there has been so much less innovation, less risk taking, more focus on sequels, more focus on monetization... basically every bad trend in the gaming industry.

Old Blizzard was concerned with making great games that happened to be very profitable. New Blizzard is concerned with making profitable games that happened to be great. Once greatness was no longer the top priority, the chinks in the armor started to appear, and my have they grown.

It is quite remarkable how much good will and prestige they have squandered. Starcraft once a prestigious franchise has been left adrift for the better part of a decade. Diablo basically ceded its crown in genre to Path of Exile. Warcraft looks very long in the tooth. Overwatch has hitched its wagon on a very dubious path to eSports. HotS has been left for dead, which is mind boggling considering the genre was invented on their own platform. These were all at some time AAA untouchable gold-plated properties that are all now empty husks of themselves.

The body bags of dying franchises are getting rolled out of Blizzard HQ. Meanwhile tone deaf execs ask if we have phones, fire huge swaths of staff, and pay top level execs $15M hiring bonuses. The wanton disconnect from their roots and their fanbase is staggering. Let it all burn and hopefully someone better will bring it back from the ashes.",I'm done with all blizzard games.

My first game was The Lost Vikings, and since then I've played everything you've ever released. I even carried your WoW Visa credit card as my main card at some point. You've invited me to several of your beta tests and I had a great time playing and reporting bugs. I got dozens of friends into your games as well. In short I'm a pretty big fan.

Or, rather, I was. Following your actions today I cannot, in good conscience, continue supporting you with my money (meager amounts in the grand scheme of things.)

Now, I'm not an activist, nor am I prone to Internet outrage. Earlier this year, however, I had a chance to visit Hong Kong. At that time I felt like it was a city that I could see myself living in. Now it's completely trashed by protests, and although I hate to see it in this state, I understand these people and relate to them.

If our country (yours and mine) was to be handed over to a brutal totalitarian regime, we wouldn't like it very much, would we? We'd probably want to do something to preserve what we have, imperfect though it may be. At the very least we would want to say something. And if someone crushed our speech for the fear of angering the impending dictatorship, it would be a pretty evil act, wouldn't it?

Don't get me wrong. I love money as much as the next guy. As a professional in the software industry I fully understand that shutting off lucrative markets to yourself is a painful thing to do. Still, do take a moment to remember all those things you enjoy in you lives. Do remember why your company was founded where it was founded. Think about what will soon be taken from a whole lot of innocent people.

I'll miss your games. I'll miss them bitterly. You are amazing at making them, and I owe you countless hours of joy over nearly three decades. That said, my only alternative is waking up every morning, looking at myself in the mirror, and not liking what I see.

That said, you may want to consider new employment if your top brass doesn’t pull their heads out of their asses. I’ve been there and done that, so I get it.*

*To all readers: Please, take freely any part of this, riff on it, make it your own. Send a message to Blizzard that their conduct in this situation is completely reprehensible and will result in lost business.*

When I was 14 years old, a couple years after my parents purchased our family’s first personal computer, I was introduced to a little game called *Warcraft*.

Real-time strategy games were new to me, and looking back, I honestly can’t think of a better introduction to the genre. Blizzard has always had a way with distilling genres and mechanics therein into simple(r)-but-pleasing expressions of their design ideology. Not often have they innovated, instead relying on their talent for recognizing what’s fun, and iterating on and refining those ideas into something of their own.

I spent many hours trying to figure out new approaches to missions I’d already completed, finding reward in successfully refining my strategy, unit compositions, and battle tactics. There was a veneer of moral ambiguity, in that there wasn’t a clean-cut dichotomy between good and evil, and you got to experience both sides of that narrative and come to moral conclusions on your own. For the first time in my nascent experience with PC gaming, I was fully engrossed in the experience in a way that only some classic JRPGs were able to grip me.

Then came *Warcraft 2*, and my first Internet connection through AOL. My first foray into multiplayer gaming over the Internet was a blast. Sure, I was smacked in the face with the unforgiving reality that other people playing not only were better than me at the game, but they were also ruthless and unapologetic for the quick dispatch of their foes. This cold, hard exercise in competition was new to me, and it was in equal measures exhilarating, fascinating, and frustrating. I was never much for physical sports, but this… *this* was cerebral and invigorating for me in a way that playing sports was not.

After a couple years, and countless *Warcraft 2* matches, I played *Diablo.* Blizzard had done it again, I thought. Without belaboring my decades-long relationship with Blizzard’s games any further, let’s just say there hasn’t been a Blizzard game since, except *Heroes of the Storm*, that I haven’t played and enjoyed to some extent. Their games have been a part of my leisure time for more than half of my life.

Today, I enjoy routine matches of *Overwatch.* I occasionally re-install *Diablo 3* to see how the meta has evolved, and if you’ve managed to get any closer to recapturing the broken magic that was *Diablo 2.* I was looking forward to finally trying out *HotS* soon, and was becoming excited for the potential announcements at Blizzcon next month.

Was.

*Was.*

Today, I am deeply disappointed and saddened by a developer who, for over two decades, has provided me with some of the most memorable and endearing gameplay experiences I’ve ever had. I am on the verge of deleting the Battle.net launcher and all Blizzard games, and never again considering any offerings they put forth.

Yesterday, you banned professional Hearthstone player blitzchung from Grand Masters for one year, and rescinded his first-place winnings in the tournament series over his decision to speak up in defense of the oppressed citizens of Hong Kong. As if that wasn’t egregious enough, you’ve also fired the two casters who teed up the situation in the offending interview. Were you within your rights to do this? Of course. Today’s TOS agreements are the legal equivalent of being pre-emptively taken to the cleaners. In the event that a customer draws the attention of you, as the service provider, over something they feel might negatively affect their revenues, you can do just about anything you want in regards to their ties to your products.

But there is the concept of the letter of the law versus the spirit of the law. You, in your apparent cowardice and shameless lust for ever-growing revenues, came down swiftly and sided with political and corporate expediency in service to your Chinese market overlords.

To kowtow so breathlessly to the totalitarian regime in China is, in a word, repulsive. It is especially painful when you shamelessly latch on to LGBTQ social causes, ostensibly in the name of social egalitarianism. In light of this event in the Hearthstone community, though, we can say without a doubt that your stand on LGBTQ rights is merely more corporate expediency masquerading as actual principles on societal values to pander to another oppressed group. 

Hong Kong has been in political crisis for months, with no end in sight. The ruthless tactics employed by China have been abysmal and unforgivable. No freedom-loving individual should look upon the ongoing situation with anything but a mournful eye, yet remain hopeful that the people of Hong Kong shall yet prevail in their struggle to retain their civil liberties. Clearly we can’t count on Western governments to flex even a bit of meaningful pressure at this political juncture.

Between China’s creeping totalitarianism and rising fascism in many Western countries, coupled with a dearth of public moral leadership willing to face down these growing threats to modern society, people can and do increasingly look to any entity--public or private--with some modicum of economic power to stand up for freedom and brook no argument to the contrary. While that expectation of corporations may be misplaced at times, and other times woefully naive, it is a very real and organic desire of the human spirit to be free to express itself. It is also innately human to seek out allies of any kind in the causes they feel are just.

Your decision strikes at the very heart of something that most humans crave very deeply--to be themselves, and to express their ideas without threat of harm--whether that harm comes from a government, a corporation, or a hate group. I fully support the Hong Kong protests and wish their people the very best, and hope for China’s complete and total failure in their attempts to further oppress the citizens of Hong Kong.

This action taken by you is unconscionable on every level. It is morally repugnant, and there is no redeeming angle from which to gaze upon this madness with a sympathetic view for you. Simply put, the only redeeming path you could commit to is a complete reversal of this decision, and to state in concrete terms that you refuse henceforth to put the desires of any oppressive regime ahead of that of freedom--not just freedom of expression, but all civil liberties.

I said previously that I’m, “on the verge,” only because I believe in the power of contrition, humility, and redemption. Everyone deserves a second chance, even developers who have been snatched up by soulless mega-corporations, but have managed in the subsequent years to maintain some semblance of what made them great in the first place. I believe that you can still redeem yourselves, regardless of my own cynicism which suggests anything but that is likely.

The clock’s ticking, Blizzard. Many fans have already reacted viscerally with a zero-tolerance slap to your finances, cancelling subscriptions to *World of Warcraft* and swearing off your future games. I do not blame those people, and I am likely to do the same in short order. But I do want to give you a chance to do the right thing. 

It’s time to get to work--and fast--to correct this most grievous error. With every day that goes by that you don’t apologize profusely and without reservation, and reverse your policy on the appeasement of the Chinese government, you will lose customers. Sure, you’ll get some of them back, but at what cost? Well, me, for starters--an ardent fan of almost 25 years. You may prevail financially for now, but it may well prove to be a Pyrrhic victory at best, having forsaken many of the very fans who’ve enabled you to rise to where you are.

If piles of convenient Chinese money are more important to you than standing with the victims of dangerous and appalling human-rights violations carried about by a totalitarian regime--financial consequences be damned--then I’ll have nothing more to do with you. And I know I’m not alone. 

May you be brought low, and swiftly, so that you may rise again, wiser and more conscientious with respect to the wide-ranging effects your actions can carry.

I wonder if the prize winnings you stole back amount to the hundreds - if not thousands of subscriptions that are going to be cancelled due to your dumb ass mistake. 

You, yourselves as a company ruined your own reputation and made Blizzard as a whole look like a joke. Imagine the lack of care everyone would have if that interview had happened, no one got fired, no money was stolen, but instead the Video was later removed for “political” issues that Blizzard would much rather have no correlation with.

Remember when Blizzard pretended to care and pandered to the oppressed people of the LGBTQ communities and started creating characters that were gay, lesbian, etc... to represent those communities? 

Looking at you Overwatch.

I saw it for what it was right away. Even with my unpopular opinion ""They are only doing it for money.""

I couldn't really back up my claim. Now I can.

You clearly don't care about the oppressed. You make decisions based on how much money you will earn or lose. I guess that's what you are supposed to do as a business.  Enjoy your stock price, I won't be making it go up.

At the end of the day you're back to watching TV/streams and playing video games without a single care to their plight.

You really want to help them? Find the organizations that *are* actively supporting them, be it via monetary funding or sending physical goods their way.

Personally, I think the position they got in when the champion mixed politics in was damned if they do, damned if they don't that they never wanted to get mixed in.

And on top of that, they attracted much more attention to the issue than if they did nothing (not saying it was intentional).

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square.

df8z44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/df8z44/this_is_where_i_draw_the_line_at_some_point_we/,1570580163,0,"Twenty-two years ago, I played Diablo for the first time.  
Played every Blizzard game ever since...  
Today, this ends.  
Forever.  
**This is where I draw the line.**  
At some point, I need to choose which world I want to make. And put my actions and money where my mouth is. This is but one little brick.

***Whenever I have a choice in the matter, I will not support, ever, a business whose values place profit over human rights — chief of which,* FREEDOM.**

____

*What follows is an attempt at voicing how I feel, probably personal, surely imperfect; it's about what this means, why I do this and from now on will enforce these principles much higher in my values. Feel free to skip and just talk!*

The reasoning is simple:

- as a business, if I were to undermine freedom, I increase the risk that one day my *own* freedoms (to create, to sell, to compete, to hire, to exist) will *also* be removed, denied, outlawed, by others;
- as a citizen and consumer, if I were to undermine my freedom or others', I send a very clear message to my leaders that I am OK with restricting liberty, with authoritarianism, with the loss of freedoms in general.

I would be accepting the connivance of corporations with states against human rights, a situation that fundamentally negates any valid implementation of democracy. The factual death of freedom as we know it, whoever we are but the hall of fame of money lords and officials.

***If we let governments dictate how businesses and citizens of the world should behave, if we destroy the free market, we are no longer in democracy, we are no longer free.***  

(Yes, US, UK and Australia, looking at your infamous ""[open letter](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/bill-barr-facebook-letter-halt-encryption)"" as well).

Make no mistake, in this day and age, freedom is dangerously challenged at its core. Democracy is more fragile and more under attack today than ever; in many ways democracy simply *hasn't been* (MIA...) in more places and moments on Earth than we like to admit in our very lifetimes.

Today, the message is crystal clear, as I delete thousands of dollars, and no fewer hours of my life. But that life was *before*, like there was Blizzard *before* this choice of theirs; and now it's changed. Today, a line is crossed, another drawn for posterity — we each have ours, apparently.

This is applicable to all corporations violating this principle, here in a quasi-parody exemplified by Activision-Blizzard; and corruption by/of any government. 

I don't want your products and services anymore. I don't care for them. They're unimportant in the grander scheme of things, when I know what they're made of. Insignificant under the light of civilization, in regards to what world I will leave my children, and all children of the world. We can do with one less hack-n-slash, one less cell phone or app brand, a few years more before technical innovation X — but we **will not** do with avoidable deaths, and worst of all a cop-out stamp of approval by some rich toy makers. No, consumerism doesn't win all, always; there's this thing called ""morality"" that most of us aspire to honor.

These products and services now pale at your lack of moral values. I would also question your morality regarding data collection and who has access. It all quite literally stinks of the danger you pose to us all, yourself very much included, when you undermine the foundation of our freedom, our wealth and happiness, as people, as families, as friends, as workers, as creators, as doctors, as artists, as storytellers, as children, as parents, as dreamers, as builders of this civilization.

Open your eyes and look above; as human beings, see the prejudice to our history, and to your name. 

When is one time one too many?

I know some of you have spoken up — or rather, covered down words that no longer carried meaning there. Thank you. From the heart, thank you. Know that you are rock stars, not just for this, but in general in life: leave this company and find a much better job for yourself, for your family and the world; do it now. You'll thank yourself every passing day thereafter — we are better, and our loved ones as well, when we work in alignment with our values.

A final word on boycott: China, as a country, is rising and that's good for its population, its peoples, who can benefit from everything the modern world has to offer. The Chinese government however, when it silences, tortures and even kills political opponents, is crossing a red line. I shall not tolerate the bullying and killing of citizens for the interests of political and economical power.

So, I boycott the Chinese government and by proxy corporations that associate with it to undermine freedom and human rights; but I do not boycott China as a country or the Chinese people because they too — they *especially* — are victims of this government and its authoritarian political regime.

There are *billions* of Chinese people, they can't *all* possibly be the same, so beware of generalizations. Your enemy is that government when it infringes on your rights, when it infringes on freedoms you deem non-negotiable, for you or anyone else. Like, speech and oh, *life*.

At some point in history, it's about time we stick together as human beings, whoever we are and wherever we live on this planet. Or under. Or beyond.

So heed this, members of states and corporations:  
**When you harm a human being, you harm *all of us*.  
Yourself very much included, as a group, as an individual citizen.**  

Open your eyes and look above;  
as a person, see the prejudice to *our* shared history,  
and to *your* name.

Consider that most corporations do not live half a human life, more like a third or less... let that sink in for a minute. Then ponder your real worth... What it is, what it could be... Ponder real hard the worth of it all. What you're willing to destroy in order to make a bigger buck.

And remember: **a good deed never comes too late. ""Now"" is always the best time to become the person you know you should be.**","This is where I draw the line. At some point, we need to choose which world we want to make.",12,2019-10-09 02:16:03,2019-10-09,0.8367966413497925,-1.0

df9i4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/df9i4e/upset_about_the_blitxchung_decision_heres_what/,1570582520,39," 

Hey, so if this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know.I know a lot of people, myself included, are upset by Blizzard/Activisions spineless decision to ban Blitxchung. After personally uninstalling all of my Blizzard games, I thought, ""what else can I do?"". The answer, is GDPR requests. Let me explain.

Under EU law, you're allowed to request all information a company has on you, along with the purpose of this information collection. What most people don't know, is that these requests are VERY hard to comply with, and can often take a companies legal group 2-7 days to complete PER REQUEST. If a company doesn't get you the information back in 30 days, they face fines and additional issues. In extreme cases, a company can request an additional 2 months to complete the requests if there is a large volume, but suffice to say, if a company gets a significant amount of requests, it can be incredibly expensive to deal with, as inevitably they will have to hire outside firms/lawyers to help out. So, if you want to submit a GDPR request, and live in the EU, you can use the following form letter, addressed to the data protection officer for Blizzard ([DPO@Blizzard.com](mailto:DPO@Blizzard.com)) or Activision (activisiion actually has an existing portal) [https://support.activision.com/gdpr?uil=en](https://support.activision.com/gdpr?uil=en)

To Whom It May Concern:

I am hereby requesting access according to Article 15 GDPR. Please confirm whether or not you are processing personal data (as defined by Article 4(1) and (2) GDPR) concerning me.

In case you are, I am hereby requesting access to the following information pursuant to Article 15 GDPR:

1. *all* personal data concerning me that you have stored;
2. the purposes of the processing;
3. the categories of personal data concerned;
4. the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed;
5. where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
6. where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
7. the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for me.

If you are transferring my personal data to a third country or an international organisation, I request to be informed about the appropriate safeguards according to Article 46 GDPR concerning the transfer.

\[Please make the personal data concerning me, which I have provided to you, available to me in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format as laid down in Article 20(1) GDPR.\]

My request explicitly includes any other services and companies for which you are the controller as defined by Article 4(7) GDPR.

As laid down in Article 12(3) GDPR, you have to provide the requested information to me without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. According to Article 15(3) GDPR, you have to answer this request without cost to me.

I am including the following information necessary to identify me:Enter your identification data here. This often includes information like your name, your date of birth, your address, your email address and so on.

If you do not answer my request within the stated period, I am reserving the right to take legal action against you and to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority.",Upset about the Blitxchung decision?

Some background

I have been a huge fan of Blizzards since starcraft. Fellin love with all there games and I'm coming up on my 15th anniversary of playing WoW! Lots of great memories and tons of friends made along the way. 



That said, I'm not really all that cash solvent at the moment and haven't been able to donate or show support for Hong Kong so like I said, I just want to thank blizzard for giving me 15$ a month I can give to 612人道支援基金_612_Humanitarian Relief_Fund[https://612fund.hk].

So uh, how are you guys? The sub has been pretty silent, I hope it gets more active soon /s

We really need to talk about what’s going on. I tried to make this post as clear as possible so it’s easily understandable, compared to something like a giant wall of text.

###Privated?

For some reason, one of our previous mods set the subreddit to private then deleted his account. It was an odd event, but rest assured, the remaining mods have)set it to public again. We apologize for the inconvenience.

###Oh, who are these new mods?

Before today/yesterday, this sub had 2 mods and 34K members and around 100-1000 active users. Right now we have around 24K active users. Earlier today we had around 45K active users.

There is no way that two were going to be able to handle that. They added a few mods that they trust (I'm one of them!). 

###Okay, but don’t you guys work for Blizzard/China?

No. We don’t work for anyone. We are members of the community, helping the community. None of our moderators are blizzard employees. We also don’t support China. We don't support any country or company. We're just here to moderate the community and participate in it. 

###How will we go back to normal?

We’re cleaning the subreddit up. We ask you to please stay on topic. Again, We do not condone Blizzard's behavior, let me make that clear. Blizzard is being scummy, and they just want money and Hong Kong protesters be damned, this fucking sucks. But this subreddit is not the place for this.","MOD MEGATHREAD - About what happened, what's happening and what we are going to do about this stuff.",0,2019-10-09 05:43:40,2019-10-09,0.5,0.17972618341445923

dg9mxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dg9mxf/moving_forward_an_apology_and_a_plan_of_action/,1570766201,624,"Hey there r/Blizzard,

Well. It’s been quite a ride these past couple days right? There are a few things that the mod team would like to address with all of you:.

**An Apology**

First things first: We have made some serious fuck ups, and we want to own up to them right now. The first fuck up was setting the sub to private the day the news of Blitzchung hit. The sub is generally low traffic, and barring something like this happening, it’s not difficult to moderate. We had a mod who was fairly new to moderating that did not know how to handle the influx of posts into the subreddit. They made a rash decision to write an announcement [pictured here](https://i.redd.it/dj7odbxnrbr31.jpg). When that did not go over well, they rage quit, privating the sub on their way out. There is no excuse for the sub having been closed as long as it was. The truth is we just didn’t see it. There was no communication from this mod through private channels, they were just gone. The two other mods were both at work, not checking the sub or modmail so we didn’t see it. We apologize, we dropped the ball in an astronomical way, and we will do better.

Secondly, the issue of the flag image removal. Some of our team was misinformed about how and why the Blizzard/Chinese flag image was removed from our subreddit. The mod team did not remove it, *Reddit* did not remove it. The OP and creator of the image deleted his own post and then his account. He has since contacted us to explain why and given permission to us to share that message. You can read it [here](https://imgur.com/a/fCONr0C).

In regard to the flag image, we will be allowing a post with it to be made to the subreddit once again as we feel it is an important symbol and hear you all when you say that it needs to be seen. I cannot say who the poster will be or if it will be a new post, but I will link it here once I've picked one.

As a team, we screwed up. No ifs ands or buts, we gave incorrect information that started a whole other witch hunt against something that Reddit is *not* doing. You can read our updated sticky comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dg2hat/this_picture_showing_the_chinese_flag_with_the/f395wvj/) and a comment from the admins [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/df6fn9/blizzard_unveils_new_logo/f39uakb/). We apologize to both the community and Reddit, we will do better.

**Censorship**

Let's talk about censorship. The mods here at r/Blizzard are not pro-China/anti-HK. Our goal with many removals was to stop duplicate posts, not to silence discussion. When I was first added to the sub, it was also being brigaded by IcePosiedon2 (and bragged about on their off-Reddit forums). We put the community into approval mode in order to stop these posts from going live on the sub. We are still in approval mode. Your posts will show as [removed] until a moderator can manually review them.

We do not wish to stifle the discussion entirely in any way, shape, or form. What we do want is to facilitate a healthy discussion, not a hateful one. We also do not want the sub’s New tab or front page to be post after post of the same image/meme/picture of you deleting your account/etc.

**Megathreads**

To that end, we have created two Megathreads to contain the most common duplicate posts we have seen in the queue. The first is for your pride in protesting via cancelling your subscriptions/deleting your accounts/general discussion about how to do these things and screenshots of you having done them. The account deletion and boycott Megathread is located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dg9jel/megathread_account_deletionblizzard_boycott/?).

The second is a Megathread for memes and other images. Post as many memes as you want in this thread, duplicates and all. They will only be removed if they incite or encourage violence or are otherwise NSFW. The meme Megathread is located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dg9f0i/megathread_memes_and_images/?).

Posts made that do not fall into either of these categories will go into modqueue for manual approval, please be patient if you don't see them for a bit. We promise, it's not personal.

In summation, we want to work with you, not against you. We have made massive mistakes. I personally have read through the modmail from when the sub was closed and I feel your anger. I am proud of the community for taking a stand against injustice, and we as a team have no desire to keep you from doing so. Going forward, memes that go into modqueue for manual approval will be removed with a comment pointing to the Megathread, same for posts about cancelling your accounts or issues doing so. Uncivil comments that do not add to a discussion will also be removed and you may be temporarily banned at moderator discretion. If you want a place to speak out, do it here, the space is open for you. It’s not open for you to be hateful, call for violence against Blizzard employees, dox them (or each other), or otherwise break Reddit Terms of Service.

If you want to protest, you absolutely should protest. This does not include harassing others. Many Blizzard employees are just like us, they also disagree about the choice their upper management made on their behalf. This is demonstrated by their own walk outs. Please keep in mind the human behind the screen, that is what we ask.

Thank you for reading,

ds74o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/ds74o9/a_message_from_the_mods/,1572994783,151,"Greetings r/Blizzard

In the previous announcement [which you can read here](https://redd.it/dqm2y2) a lot of the feedback we received from users was that the ""other side"" of the debate was an indefensible position. It seems like a substantial amount of people believe that if you don't care about the Hong Kong situation then you're a bad person.

Having read thousands of comments posted to the sub over the last few weeks, something that's been repeated over and over is the idea that protesting is not all or nothing. You can boycott Blizzard and continue to use your iPhone without being a hypocrite. Doing your part, however small, can make a difference in the world. So in light of that, how can anyone argue that the people who aren't interested in the Hong Kong situation are bad people? You can't assume that they're not protesting some other issue, one you're perhaps blissfully unaware of. Similarly, you cannot argue that the people boycotting Blizzard are hypocrites. It just so happens that this is the issue that's important to them.

We don't believe that ""the other side"" of the argument is ""I don't care."" The other side of the argument would be being Pro-China. The number of comments *that are actually pro-China* are vanishingly small. Most of the ones we've seen have also seen those users banned, as they were clearly sock puppet accounts pushing Chinese propaganda. They were saying that the protesters in Hong Kong are terrorists funded by foreign governments, or that the protesters were murdering people, and on and on.

Something we want people commenting in the subreddit to think about is ""What is my goal?"" We ask this because we believe that most people have good intentions. Even those calling others shills, bootlickers or accusing others of supporting organ harvesting. If you want to appeal to others and change their mind to support your position, personally attacking them is not the way to go about it. All personally attacking them accomplishes is pushing people away from being open to your position entirely, simply writing off you and others who hold your beliefs as assholes.

The last concern frequently mentioned is the age of this account. Many subreddits use joint mod accounts to post announcements. A few (now former) mods of *this* subreddit quit after users relentlessly harassed them for posting announcements like this one. Merely telling users to be kinder to one another in the previous thread had dozens of people accusing the mod team of being paid shills under the employ of the CCP or Blizzard - despite the subreddit being awash with criticism of China and Blizzard for weeks. I've known mods who have received phone calls wherein the person on the other end threatened to murder them and their family. The internet can be a dangerous and unpredictable place. People are very angry right now about this issue and we're not taking any chances.

evet60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/evet60/word_of_warning_about_shadowlands_preorders/,1580258232,8," reposting from r/wow to spread the warning

**Backstory:**  I pre-purchased shadowlands last December on the 25th after  resubscribing on the 20th, and ended up quitting WoW after finishing the  anniversary event stuff near new years. I never used the pre-order  bonus of making allied death knights, nor did I even do the quest to get  the pre-order xmog set as I didnt have any interest in it. Time passes a  bit without me playing, only ever logging in during the first couple of  days of the new patch, as I've found my time occupied by different  games (it'll be obvious which if you look at my recent post history).  Worth noting that the two days I logged in on in January was before my  original $15 sub purchase ended. I realized the other night that I  probably wont be going back to WoW again, due to a mixture of distaste for acti-blizzard practices, not really seeing any of the content revealed at blizzcon as interesting enough to me on second look, and  that I found other games (read: mmos) to fill the hole left by WoW when I quit. I know that during the bfa pre-order period they allowed  pre-orders to be refunded by pretty much anyone who didn't unlock and  use the allied races, and seeing as I did not create any allied race death knights (or pandas for that matter), nor did I do the quest for the xmog set, I figured I would be in the clear.

**Here is the important part:**  As it would turn out, the pre-order came with 30 days of game time,  while cool for an active player, isn't of much use to an inactive player/somebody who's decided to quit. This game time activated automatically just a few days ago despite me not logging in to WoW or even the battlenet launcher at all recently. When I went to make my  pre-order refund request, my negligence to the fact that those ""bonus"" 30 days had already auto-activated despite myself not being active  pretty much [bit me in the butt](https://i.imgur.com/B9ue4se.png), even though I never actually played during the period said bonus days had been active for, nor do I plan to use any of them.

Bascally,  if you plan to pre-purchase, make sure you sort out the bonus game time  to not activate, in the event you need to refund for financial reasons,  or maybe if the alpha/beta proves disappointing. Otherwise you're just  gonna be short $80 with nothing but an expansion you dont want to play  to show for it. My lesson here is to avoid hype pre-ordering, as now I'm  down $80 that I could've really used going in to the next month.",Word of warning about Shadowlands pre-orders.,1,2020-01-29 01:37:12,2020-01-29,0.17945021390914917,0.5

&amp;#x200B;

* **Serious FPS issues.** I have a powerful graphics card and I can barely play this game. I The main menu screen when the game loads up is unbelievably slow, which is very odd since it isn't even a regular level. I spent the first half hour trying to get the game to be playable by tinkering with various settings and restarting the game to see if it made a difference.
* **Constant crashes.** The game has crashed several times for me. Each time I have sent the report to Blizzard and restarted the game.
* **Constant freezing.** This game has frozen my entire machine three times now, and I have been unable to get back to my desktop and have had to kill my computer and restart it. Very frustrating.
* **Saving issues.** This is the weirdest problem. Because of the aforementioned issues, I have saved the game more than usual, only to have it crash a few minutes later. When I load it back up, my most recent save is gone. I have given the saved games special names and confirmed that they appear in the LOAD menu and they still disappear after a crash sometimes. Not every time, but it has happened like 4 times now.

My advice? Don't buy the game until these bugs are worked out. Honestly, I am just very disappointed in Blizzard right now.",WC3: Reforged Issues So Far,4,2020-01-29 05:07:28,2020-01-29,0.5,0.0066120922565460205

It just makes not much sense. Highest profit in 2018 ever and letting 800 ppl go. That they still need for some tasks. So even if they are a bit overcrowded, letting this many by a total of 9600 employees go... I mean, someone has to do the work. So more stress, worse working climate. Somehow it seems all connected.

Please Fix/Add these things:  
  
0.5. FIX ONLINE, I know that is being worked on but cmon... lets get onto the proper things:  
  
1. Allow Classic Launcher downloads for people that don't want to update to the Reforged Launcher.  
2. Fix the Crashing bug on Campaign.  
3. Fix the Save bug that resets progress.  
4. Re-Add LAN + Singleplayer custom games that don't require online.  
5. Re-add Add Ladder.  
6. Integrate stats from the old profiles at least, otherwise bring them  back.  
7. Re-Add Custom Campaigns, this is unforgivable. 
8. Don't region lock, if you if you have to, make region tabs IN GAME, so people can choose without having to jump in and out constantly.  
9. Focus on polishing the environmental models, the unit models are overdone by comparison, it feels like the outsourcing of those models overshot what the aesthetic of WC3 was supposed to be.  
10. Allow modifying UI scaling, this option is important for different scaled monitors and also people with visibility problems.  
11. Profanity Filter tick box is broken, it does nothing, everything is censored no matter what.  
12. Allow choice between Reign of Fire balance and TFT balance in Campaign and Custom. I would say for versus but I don't hold much hope for that.  
13. Allow more sound options, I wish to turn down the movement sounds, not turn them completely off, so the same for other sound effects.  
14. Engine updates, make the game more stable, lag issues and freezing seems to be a common issues, if you are worried about crossplay, simply have things that are ""Reforged Only"" as a tag, using functions that aren't in classic.  
15. Rework your TOS, a lot of people will be turned off making custom maps and assets for WC3 with the waving of rights to own them. Also do not try to police moral rights and simply let it be a platform, not a publisher, I am sure Bethesda doesn't like LoversLab, but they at least don't act against it.  
  
Now for some less important but still things we would want to see:  
  
16. Re-add 3D scenes to each act before you start, they current are decent 2D animated gif sort of things, this is an art choice and it subjective I suppose but people do miss it when it was grand and 3D animated.  
17. Please deliver new VO's, allow for the old VO's too as an option but seeing a new spin on WC3 is a great thing, I know it was scary to do that, but now you can see people actually want a new experience, since they THOUGHT that the old experience wasn't going away.  
18. Please remake the Cinematics. You have came SO FAR in your cinematics department and again, nothing is wrong with having a new spin on WC3, as long as the old experience still exists.  
19. Re-Add /Commands.  
20. Re-Add personal ping. Also add Networking options.  
  
Now for things we hope to see once all this is fixed:  
21: Continue to support the game with bugfixes and graphical updates.  
22: Have events, bring people together with both casual and hardcore activities.  
23: Skin unlocks and portrait unlocks, please don't go overboard with monetization. Focus on event and achievement unlocks.  
24: Additional Maps and possibly new Campaigns past TFT based on Warcraft Lore. Keep Maps at least free, Campaigns can be how you make your money as mini expansion packs (Maybe even new races? so long as you keep them ""Optional"" in custom melee set ups).  
25: Improve the Editor, allow for more freedom and give modders more to work with, take a page from old Bethesda.",Blizzard please read this: (A Complete list of things),1,2020-01-29 19:33:42,2020-01-29,0.8122040629386902,0.8645113706588745

I have been attempting to play WC3:RF since it came out, I have managed to play a few prologue missions and 2 or 3 full versus matches without crashing. Extremely unhappy I decided to refund the game, as is my legal right under Australia Consumer Law.

The automated process was instantly denied due to ""too much playtime"" so I appealed to the live chat. Right from the get go it did not go well, Apparently ""all purchases are final"" but they can still offer refunds if they want to, eg: https://i.imgur.com/6zhS2al.png

What follows is the chat log from that conversation, where the Blizzard representative states that Australian Consumer Law does not apply to a US company. I think Steam would disagree (https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/online-shopping/buying-online/articles/buying-online-from-overseas-retailers)

&gt; You are now chatting with Nypolden.

&gt; Nypolden at 15:14, Jan 30:
&gt; 
&gt; Hello hello, how is the day treating you so far?

&gt; You at 15:14, Jan 30:

&gt; ok

&gt; Nypolden at 15:15, Jan 30:
&gt; 
&gt; Good to hear

&gt; Nypolden at 15:15, Jan 30:
&gt; 
&gt; I see you were wanting to check out a possible refund for Warcraft 3: Reforged?

&gt; You at 15:15, Jan 30:

&gt; yes please

&gt; Nypolden at 15:15, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; I can take a look and see. We do view all purchases as final so a refund will not be guaranteed.

&gt; You at 15:16, Jan 30:

&gt; well, unfortunately that's not how consumer law works here in australia

&gt; Nypolden at 15:17, Jan 30:
&gt; 
&gt; Our Terms of sale state that all purchases are final. Accepting those terms of sale does mean you agree to them.

&gt; You at 15:17, Jan 30:

&gt; again, your terms of sale do not override consumer rights

&gt; Nypolden at 15:17, Jan 30:
&gt; 
&gt; You purchased a game from a US shop from a US company.

&gt; You at 15:18, Jan 30:

&gt; in australia, in australian dollars

&gt; Nypolden at 15:18, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; Governed by US laws. I'm afraid that there has been a considerable amount of game play so we will not be able to refund the purchase.

&gt; You at 15:18, Jan 30:

&gt; you mean the time that i spent trying to start a match

&gt; You at 15:18, Jan 30:

&gt; or crashing the campaign 18 times?

&gt; Nypolden at 15:20, Jan 30:
&gt; 
&gt; I would recommend posting on the tech support or bug report forums for Warcraft 3: Reforged.

&gt; You at 15:20, Jan 30:

&gt; will that add all the missing features that have been removed?

&gt; You at 15:21, Jan 30:

&gt; how am I meant to know these features are missing without actually trying to play the game?

&gt; Nypolden at 15:21, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; You can send your feedback to the developers that way.

&gt; You at 15:21, Jan 30:

&gt; no, because the issue is, your website advertised a product that is inaccurate and misleading

&gt; You at 15:22, Jan 30:

&gt; there is a specific example of an improvement to a campaign cutscene that is not even in the final product


&gt; You at 15:22, Jan 30:

&gt; still advertised on a selling page for a live product

&gt; Nypolden at 15:23, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; Again that is all feedback best suited for the community forums where the developers can see it.

&gt; You at 15:23, Jan 30:

&gt; no, that is false advertising, a completely different matter

&gt; Nypolden at 15:24, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; Was there anything else I can address before I let you go?

&gt; You at 15:24, Jan 30:

&gt; yes

&gt; You at 15:24, Jan 30:

&gt; In 2016, US online game retailer Valve was fined $3 million for making false or misleading representations on its distribution platform, Steam, about consumers' rights to refunds for games that were not of acceptable quality.

&gt; You at 15:25, Jan 30:

&gt; ""These proceedings, and the significant penalties imposed, should send a strong message to all online traders operating overseas that they must comply with the Australian Consumer Law when they sell to Australian consumers,""

&gt; Nypolden at 15:25, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; I've already addressed that. Due to how much time has been spent in the game, we will not be able to refund.

&gt; Nypolden at 15:25, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; Was there anything else other than your refund request that I can address? If not I will need to end the chat.

&gt; You at 15:25, Jan 30:

&gt; you have not actually addressed it, you have made an arbitary decision based off a factor that you ahve not explained

&gt; You at 15:25, Jan 30:

&gt; what is the limit in time for a refund per your policy?

&gt; You at 15:26, Jan 30:

&gt; and, can you tell the difference between time the game is open and actual time played of the game?

&gt; Nypolden at 15:26, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; That's not information we are able to openly discuss as the terms state that all sales are final.

&gt; You at 15:27, Jan 30:

&gt; yes but, as a retailer that operates in Australia you are required to follow the law, which states a refund must be available for a product that does meet acceptable standards or has major defects that prevent it from being used for its intended process

&gt; Nypolden at 15:27, Jan 30:

&gt; 
&gt; Since there isn't anything else I can address I'll let you go. Take care.

&gt; Info at 15:27, Jan 30:

&gt; Thank you for chatting with us.

That was the end of the chat. I have since written a letter based off the ACCC recommendations and will be forwarding it to Blizzard soon.

For those of you upset about the quality of WC3 Reforged, or (justifiably) angry that you aren't getting a refund, I submit this as a reminder that the Blizzard you loved is gone. This letter was posted a year ago. Do you think Blizzard learned anything from it? Were inspired by it? Motivated by it? 

Or does it seem like they really just ignored it.

If you want Blizzard to wake up from this greed induced stupor, you have to stop rewarding them for delivering garbage cash-grab products. You have to admit to yourself at least on some tiny level, if you've pre-ordered Diablo3... WC3 Reforged... BFA... in your own small way you created this problem.

Don't pre-order games. If you've pre-ordered Shadowlands, refund it while you still can. Don't pre-order Diablo 4. Don't pre-order Overwatch2. I used to pre-order Blizzard games and expansions too.

Keep faith, there are no even one game launch without bugs and etc. Blizzard will fix it all soon.

Blizzard was a name that pretty much defined the modern game studio to me.  There were others, but when I considered moving into game design, it was the Blizzard designs and the stories it’s people developed that made me consider it as a goal in life to make games.

For the longest time, I thought “If I could ever get hired by Blizzard, I will have made it.  It’s the best game company I could ever work for.”

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t feel that anymore.  And that makes me sad.  I’m 48.  Maybe I would have never gotten onboard anyway.  I deal with the idea that I need to improve to reach my goals...

I also know Blizzard is a company, not a person.  It’s goal is to make money.    


...

&amp;#x200B;

But does it HAVE to be such a dick about it?  Does nobody in management recognize if your going to be evil, at least hide it a bit better?

Between how it’s treating the professional gamers they lured in and abandoned, stifling the causes and opinions of people that speak out on things that offend aggressive governments, and now, attempting the stripmine the ip and skills of the people they rely on to make there games relevant after they would often stop making new content?  I’m done.

Even if they about face at this point, they have already made it clear they will do anything that people will let them get away with.  I’ll keep consulting with smaller indie companies, and see if they can be steered away from the behavior that is obviously the standard in the biggest gaming industries.    


I’m just torn about buying the games they produce.  I don’t want to punish artists and programmers, writers and designers.  They’re just trying to do the same thing I like doing.  Making games.  But I don‘t want to keep rewarding the bad faith of the companies that employ them.

Nearly everything that it has made in the last few years has been a massive disappointment. All that Blizzard cares for now is to make a quick buck by exploiting the expectation that they had built up before in which they made amazing games. I will never purchase another Blizzard product again. Diablo 4 included. Thank you Blizzard for ruining everything you've ever made. Thank you for putting the expectations of shareholders and the wallets of executives above the respect and prestige you had garnered painstakingly throughout the years.  


Diablo 3 was horrible. Its expansion did save it somewhat, but then the development staff for it was gutted to cut costs when they were actually making the game fun and interesting. The Seasons that they are doing is the only thing that they have going for it, but a small game called ""Path of Exile"" has ended up usurping Blizzard's throne when it comes to ARPGs.   


Starcraft 2 is just one giant micro-transaction now that the campaign is finished. The competitive scene is still great, but it frankly is just getting worse and worse. Co-Op is great, until you've ended up playing the same say.. 8 maps over and over again for weeks on end because good, new, and unique custom games are few and far between each other.  


Heroes of the Storm got gutted after they had made their attempt at getting into the ""MOBA"" market after they realized that the games that NON-BLIZZARD PEOPLE MADE to FURTHER ENJOY WARCRAFT 3 were great. Instead of encouraging and teaming up with their game's content creators, they instead scorned them.

Warcraft 3 ""Reforged"" is a travesty. A disaster even. It will more than likely be one of the biggest things to break this already festering with rot and diseased money mule that is Blizzard's back. The fact that anything and everything that anyone makes for the game now is considered their ""property"" and that the people who made such things have no right to what they made is abhorrent. The community that had built up around this game to this day has just been slapped in the face. They ruined the game in too many ways that I can only shake my head in reaction. They deliberately lied to the consumers and fraudulently advertised greater quality than what was supplied. They completely annihilated old warcraft 3, making it so that people are unable to play how it used to be after forcefully having to update it. (I have CD copies and cd keys thankfully) And so on, and so on, and so on.   


World of Warcraft started to become stale when they continued to make the same thing over and over again, being innovative or creative once in a while and then milking what they had done right until it ended up being ruined for everyone. The story just goes around in circles over and over again, with the horde being the bad guy every time, and the Alliance having no villains or ""BBEGs"" of the expansion.   


All in all, screw you Blizzard. Screw you for ruining every single one of your legacies that you had made, and thank you for showing everyone how much you dont care for you community, your fans, and those who grew up playing the games that you made. All you are is just a cesspool of greed and avarice. I had always dreamed of going to Blizzcon, and now I vow to never go to one even if It was free.

This was the Blizzcon that made the initial promises for Warcraft 3, and was part of a clear vision to bridge the gap between all of their current products. Warcraft 3 would release in Summer 2019, which would flow into the release of classic in August 2019 as Arthas' story is the connective tissue of the first three WoW experiences. Added in Reforged would be additional context for various characters, which would have tied into the BfA storylines of Jaina and Slyvanas.   


This vision was completely offset by the massive stock dip. February 2019, they were forced to lay off \~800 employees, while refocusing 20% more of their budget to development. Some of the laid-off workers were in the midst of a community outreach initiative that was collecting feedback on the hot-button issues of modern World of Warcraft. The extent of community manager involvement in the current game is unknown, but it is safe to say that many short-term plans were scrapped. To top-off 2019, the Blitzchung event resulted in a major PR disaster.   


Blizzard was well aware that Warcraft 3: Reforged would be a flop after 2018, but they had no intention  of refunding preorders and cancelling the project. Instead, they scaled back the project; using the already-developed models and up-rezzing the old CG cinematics so that they could ship the product. They knew that letting CS handle the backlash was easier than cutting their losses and refunding everyone.  


While this is all terrible corporate soullessness, I do suspect that the future products; Diablo 4, Shadowlands, and Overwatch 2 will benefit from a renewed focus, as products slated from 2018-2020 will continue to suffer from cut costs and corners.",These events are the effects of 2018,1,2020-01-31 04:38:30,2020-01-31,0.5,0.2391349971294403

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I also have no concern sharing the account username at some point.

Frankly, Activision-Blizzard is dead to me.

They've driven what made me love them into the ground, then have managed to surpass all other contenders and drill their way into bedrock in their pursuit of lower standards of behavior.

I had a feeling this was coming all the way back at *""You all have phones, don't you?""* What kind of gaming company is so out of touch with their fan-base that they even thought for a minute that setup wouldn't lead to disaster?

What made me cancel all my Activision-Blizzard subscriptions and stop using any of their products, though, was the blatant toadying to China. An event that cemented their position as ""Worst Gaming Company"" in my eyes.

Now, with their latest debacle of false promises and corporate greed, the only thing I have left to do in protest is to permanently delete my [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) account, which I've already done. A token gesture, to be certain, since I never intended to give Activision-Blizzard another dime of my money anyway, but a gesture I feel had to be made.

I was half tempted to destroy the physical install media for my original release purchases of all the vintage Blizzard games, then I realized... the Blizzard that made these time-honored mainstays of gaming culture ceased to exist after Activision took control. These discs are a treasured relic of an old friend that has sadly passed, ravaged by cancer.

I think enjoying products from the *real* Blizzard, made back when they had the integrity to drop a project that wasn't going to be of acceptable quality, is the better way to show my disdain for the mockery the company has become.","So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodbye",1,2020-01-31 08:56:40,2020-01-31,0.5,0.026839643716812134
ewl4p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/ewl4p2/the_soft_stick_and_the_hard_stick/,1580457657,1,"So just looking at the reviews and such about WC3 Reforged, and its makes me think about a larger problem that exists in this modern ""pre-order, microtransaction, loot box"" gaming world that we live in today. (This world that didn't exist when WC3 came out)

Now I'm a libertarian through and through, which means I don't really like governmental regulations, as government isn't very good at doing much other then waging war. That being said, I've always held a strong belief in self regulation of the commercial sector, IE, you buy a product, product sucks, or is defective, and a company that wants to maintain their image offers you a refund. If I went to say a ford dealership and I bought a 2020 F-150, I signed the papers, they handed me the keys, and I got in it, turned over the engine the the engine compartment exploded, I imagine I'd get a refund for having a defective product, lots of apologies and some free stuff. Now this is an extreme and silly example, but it makes the point clear.

In a healthy market, these actions would be rarefied by companies wanting to not lose customers, and also by companies not wanting bad pr, reviews would spread to warn people, word of mouth would fall afoul of that company. These actions I like to call the ""soft stick"". But it seems that in gaming the growth of the customer base is enough for companies to just completely screw over their consumers without batting an eye. This is very unhealthy for all parties involved.

Now the part that makes my cognitive dissonance kick in, I think the only answer is by using the ""Hard Stick"". The hard stick is... well when you are being mistreated by a bully who doesn't care that they are mistreating you and you have no recourse, you find a bigger bully to mistreat them. That my friends is where the biggest mafia in the world come into the picture, the government! Some governments already have some good consumer protections, like Australia, and even the EU I believe has some. However here in the good old USA we lack alot of those digital consumer protections. But there is a way to possibly fix this, that is to file complaints here (if you live in the US)

 [https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection) 

And also send emails, phone calls, letters ect.. to your district representatives about this non-sense. Selling defective goods and then refusing to refund your money on a product that doesn't function or doesn't function as intended.

Just watching the gaming industry over the years, I really feel like the Hard Stick is the only real hope we have.

&amp;#x200B;

I have personally already filed a compliant with the US Federal Trade Commission that I have been scammed by Blizzard-Activision, I was shown materials indicating what product I would receive, and when I used that product for the very first time I found out that it was not designed, built, or working at intended, and that they do not offer refunds if you have actually used the product.

Please before continue reading take a seat and warning the situation is really awful.

I was first a little bit surprised as my noticed that units had troubles with way find, I command my handful of melee orcs just to attack a unit, 6 vs 1 and they have a problem to get close to him, to hit him.
- units had troubles with way find

Than started to play Alliance campaign and noticed one essential feature was missing.

- J wasn't able to change the speed of the game.
Yes, they did not add in year 2020 the option to change speed, which is available in every Blizzard RTS.
Since WC2, 3 SC Remastered and 2 you have that feature, but not here.

- Than I noticed the cut scenes were completely different than promised.

I started to investigate, if maybe I did launch accidentally a beta version, maybe the game was delayed to 2021, not 2020. 

Here info, who made the game. here proof

Warcraft III: Reforged didn't deliver lot of promises. 

The very same cutscenes as in classic, no improvements.
No new campaigns.
No new interface.
No new custom game lobbies.
No new reworked Story Elements.
and removed a lot of features.

It goes even worse: Warcraft 3 fans no longer have access to the Classic client and its extra features. So you basically can't play the Superior old game online anymore.

My name is Victor Maia, I'm the creator of [Formality](https://github.com/moonad/formality), the 3rd largest proof language on Github (soon 2nd?) and the only made from the beginning for normal development (the others focus mainly academic usage). Proof languages are like ultra-secure programming languages that can state and prove mathematical theorems about themselves. To show to the world that those can be used to make normal apps, I'm developing a MOBA on it, [TaelinArena](https://github.com/moonad/taelinarena). But beyond that, I also want to show that games can thrive even when you all the corporate greed out of the equation and make something out of pure love.

How will it be different? First of all, it is and will always be completely open-source. But it goes beyond that; it aims to reverse the economic model behind modern games. It won't be **free-to-play** nor **pay-to-win**, it will be **get-paid-to-win** and **get-paid-to-create**. Users will be able to create their own heroes and submit for approval. Approved heroes will be listed for casual play for free, and for ranked play for a small fee. Every time someone pays for a hero, the money goes mostly to the creator of the hero and to a pool to be redistributed to competitive players, with a small part beign used for its maintenance (dev salaries, servers, etc.). I won't profit with it, so, if it ever succeeds, all the money goes to creators and competitive players. And I can't go back on that decision, or else someone would just fork it! But what do I gain with that? A regular salary working in something I love, and fun game to play, of course! I can't wait to do so. 

But can I do it? Absolutely! 2 weeks of actual development and I already have a ultra-fast, handmade sparse-voxel-octree renderer for its unique art-style, which is neither 2d pixel art nor 3d models, but ""voxel art"", which has the aesthetics of 2d, but with enough info to, for example, cast lights, which is impossible with traditional sprite art. I also have an bit-per-bit optimized WebRTC netcode which I stress tested across the globe and feels smooth as hell. The physics is being developed in Formality and the whole compiling-to-JS pipeline is working. I have a team of ~10 well-paid artists to create the art. There is still a lot to do, but, at this pace, the game will be playable very soon!

I have a lot to say about the game itself and how I plan to fix many mistakes made on existing e-sports, and make the fairest, most exciting competitive game in the world, but the post is already too long as is. If you like my ideas and want to support me, please follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/maiavictr) (I'm new there, but will be announcing). Sometimes I also stream the development of the game and teach some type theory on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/maiavictr).

I'm not gonna support the dumpster fire that is blizzard... This is what happens when a corporation becomes too greedy and believes that their high-and-mighty and no one can touch them... I can't believe I'm saying this but blizzard has become Electronic Arts... Greedy, Egotistical, Hostile, Disrespectful... I'll start with the 1st one.. greedy- thankfully I did not buy the newest Warcraft 3 (as I couldn't afford it at this moment either through pre-order or just straight-up order it after)

 But unfortunately a friend of mine .

he tried to open the game And about 35 seconds in the game alternately crashed. He tried again and the same thing happened the game literally crashed at about 30 seconds into the loading process. He contacted support thinking that they would have a solution and they told Him that the game is loading perfectly. He explained to them it's not and it's crashing after 30 seconds and the representative told him well that's not our problem. He then said well it is your problem because I'm going to be asking for a refund. They told him because he open the game they could tell how long he had played the game and No refunds would be issued. He again told the representative that the game would crash after 30 seconds and he was unable to play any part or the game and the representative told him ""  This is normal for the process of the game to load that it will shut down. Just keep trying and enjoy your game. "" he then said that the game is simply not loading and he wants a refund especially because of all the negativity around it.. The representative said no  refund will be issued have a good day...

   I am at a loss of words... That tells you how much they respect gamers, And fans of their products... If they're doing this with warcraft... Just imagine what Diablo is going to look like...

It makes me feel better when I see fellow gamers upset at the current business strategy of the market today.  Sadly the repeated grief isn’t enough lessons for most to see the pattern to make both better finical and entertainment decisions. Until then you will continue to suffer from your own hand. I hope one day wisdom would be bestowed upon you and with that, change. 

Today it’s common place to purchase an unfinished product, a beta. Betas were free, because you would provide valuable feedback on bugs what aspect of the product was good bad. But you made the purchase instead. 

Today it’s common place to purchase visual skins and loot boxes, they were free, because the industry used this as a lure and to complete with other titles. That’s the cost of business and what you paid for.  But you made the purchase instead. 

Marketing departments used to be honest. If not there would be back lash. But backlash doesn’t matter or have that much weight now, because you will make the purchase anyway.  

Bug fixes and issues weren’t really much of a thing, when discovered they were fixed. But it doesn’t matter, you bought the DLC so there is no need to fix it.

A decent gaming company that had a proven track record will cash out and sell that branding. It is purchased by a known documented offender of the above, but you made the purchase. 

The industry once upon a time had heart too it. Your opinion matter because it was art and it was personal. When you made a purchase you were buying in to the game and its content in full. Now everything is half baked and anything that looks cool you need to buy, because you specifically have shown the industry that you will.

The answer is simple, staring you right in the face. Ready to take action or perhaps you need to spend more to learn this lesson.","This isn't what I paid for. Well, of course not.",1,2020-01-31 21:46:07,2020-01-31,0.8117987513542175,0.9294925928115845

I'm not raging, I'm not angry, I'm just done...

Probably the closest analogy is Disappointed Dad... Just without the unconditional love...
I'm just done...

I used to pick up every single Blizzard game, without question. And for those who think this is just a recent thing, it's not. This decline has been gradual and over many years, let me explain.


StarCraft 2 in it's 3 episodes was amazing... Every single episode was brilliant. They were the last time I got my hands on a Blizzard product where it just felt jam packed with quality, was pure StarCraft and oozing polish...


Diablo 3 was quality but wasn't Diablo... I'm not just talking the appearance but the way the skill system is done... We went from 30 abilities and skill points to min-max as we choose with synergies and effects and ended up with a simplified ARPG light on RPG and horror... RoS managed to add Necro, which I loved, so much... But it's still stuck in a not-Diablo game... It was just not enough, no branching story or evolving regions but basically just a simplified D2 with all the good bits ripped out and shinier graphics.


Hearthstone was a quasi distraction that while good in it's own right was more of a stop-gap between games, be it when you're out and about or referring to between actual releases.


Heroes of the Storm was just too little, toolate... If it was a year or two earlier, it may have made it... But while I loved it, it never felt like a big title, it felt like another Hearthstone, it was filling the gap between titles.


WoW, the stalwart over the years... Well I found it aged in 2010... It's now 10 years later... Sure classic was fun, simply because it could be challenging again... But it's still aged.


Overwatch... Great release, it stemmed the decline and was a quality new release that we needed... But then the dev team spent most of their time tweaking existing content rather than adding new content... Those sorts of games need regular new maps, new heroes, not simplified arcade game-modes or an over-reliance on events. God forbid anyone wants a clan or guild system that you still hadn't implemented 2 years on, despite making enough cash through loot boxes to buy a small nation.


The decline continued...


Diablo Immortal... I don't need to explain this do I?


Blitzchung... Oh Blizzard, you show your true corporate colours now... I was a bit angry but mostly surprised at how unsurprised I was... Particularly after DI.


Diablo 4... Am I the only one who looked at it and was like 'it looks like D3 with shaders and colour pallette jacked in certain directions' to make it 'feel' darker... I hope I'm wrong...


Overwatch 2... Hmmmm so basically an actual content release for a live service game, rebranded as a sequel or new release?


And thus we get to WC3RF...

When I first saw it, my reaction was 'great, another game getting remastered when they could be working on something new and actually requires some vision and imagination, like WC4'

Cool I might pick it up, I did love WC3, but unless they actually improve a bunch of the outdated systems and stuff, no one will realise how garbage the idea is until release... I mean at that point it's basically starting to get into remake territory not remaster territory.

The announcements kept coming and I was quietly hopeful... I mean I didn't pre-order; not in this day and age, not with a AAA studio at least.

Then this happens... Yep so it's a classic remaster, with the barest of improvements, and a stack of promises broken.


I'm not angry, just disappointed...


I'm done...

I've never been big on Overwatch and I'm mainly only into Diablo as a series from Blizzard (even enjoyed 3 :O), but I remember when I heard about Overwatch 2, thinking it was odd that they were touting it as a huge thing; it looked to me as, at worst DLC, at best content that could have been an add-on to the original game. 

Am I missing something? Is there something that makes OW2 deservedly be a boxed sequel?

Games like Warframe have added more than what OW2 is going, including graphical updates, so I can't see their angle on this.

The only reason this is puzzling to me is how media seems to be eating up Blizzards pitch:

I’m offering my services as a Moral Compass Officer. We can discuss salary and benefits later, but mostly I feel I have a duty to the world to fill this position for you.

Although my role will be simple, it is clearly desperately needed, and I anticipate at least a 60 hour work week which will be filled with fielding questions and providing binding responses.

The questions I anticipate are those such as:
“We want to do this [insert stupid thing]. Can we?”
“We would really like to [insert evil thing]. Should we?”
“We have an idea that we would like to implement that [insert idea that totally alienates and infuriates fans that have been loyal for literal decades] may we?”

My responses to all the above would be a firm NO. Hopefully you can already see the incredible value my services can add to your company. If not, I would be pleased to discuss further. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Anytime a game is that close to release and has so little review content available, red flags start to go off. If the game is good... if it can withstand basic scrutiny... then why wouldn't a publisher want reviewers to public info about the game? Sure, there are certain types of games (MMO's and other online-only games) that wouldn't be appropriate to review before release, but WC3??? This game had been out for over a decade and had significant single-player components.

Needless to say I was not surprised by what happened post-launch, because other games with no early reviews taught me exactly what to expect.

I still can't believe that he is gone.

We played alot of games.. We played Advanced Warfare, Destiny and later on alot of Overwatch. He loved Blizzard and he loved World of Warcraft. WoW was his game..

exd0hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/exd0hg/goodwill_vs_profits/,1580592891,2,"I've been noticing a trend with American corporate gaming companies lately like Bethesda, EA and the likes of Activision Blizzard that what they all have in common is prioritizing profits over goodwill. 

What is goodwill?
""the established reputation of a business regarded as a quantifiable asset and calculated as part of its value when it is sold.""

You know that feeling when you hear CD Projekt RED announce a new game and youre like duck yeaa compared to if you hear Besethda is releasing a new Fallout and youre like duck no. Yea that's good will.

Goodwill when there is a lot of it, there is trust, positive brand image, loyal customers. Though goodwill doesnt give you profits immediately it rewards you with profits over the life of your brand. 
Take Ghost Town games for example, the developers of overcooked 2. To this day, the devs have constantly released new and tons of free content, maps and chefs (which the dont have to) for people who own the game and don't necessarily want to pay for their dlc. For me and my girlfriend, we've had tons of fun and experiences with the game itself and it always makes us come back for more. Personally if they release a new game, I'm more than likely to feel positively towards it and trust it and therefore support and buy their games. 
I'm sure you can come up with other devs indie or other that you feel this way about.

To me, Ghost Town games has an asset that Activision Blizzard, EA, and Bethesda dont have or have lost... It's goodwill, and that's something you can't really put a price on in the consumers eyes.

Going through this subreddit its quite clear to me that Blizzards lost their built up goodwill and so have the others.

If Blizzards going to gain the trust of its community again, it's got to stop prioritising profits over goodwill.",Goodwill vs. Profits,1,2020-02-01 22:34:51,2020-02-01,0.5,0.8582391738891602

Blizzard we all know that you don't care from some time about your fanbase as you should(well, you should,  probably just because we all paying you to care). Knowing this Reforged looks just like a cashgrab - and thats ok, no one make games from pure passion but I think you can make cashgrab and keep everyone happy. I can tell you - you can easly turn this whole bad PR and witch hunt but it's up to you(Activision?) and earn twice times or more on the same content you already have.

\- Make Reforged as you promised - people paid for game you showed them in 2018 so deliver it  
\- Make it playable  
\- Don't take people rights about creativity - if its about dota, lol, td etc its only your fault that you were lazy to not cashgrab it earlier but if you take this right from people your game will not develop as original w3 and there will be no more cashgrab, even for you  


and your potential of World of Warcraft:  
Right now you are making more content than Ubisoft in time when they thrown AC after AC so make proper base from Reforged you have Reign of Chaos, Frozen Throne but also you have WoW Vanilla, TBC, WoTLK with plenty of lore to make another campaings - you can throw it year after year, polishing Reforged and earning money (you sell 2x same content - good cashgrab) but to do that you need to polish base game first - do it, repair it, earn money - no one form your fanbase have problem with paying you, but ffs just do it properly, because all this shitstorm it's not about remaster, only about you lied and deliver sth different than you promised.

Sometimes I don't know why I even bother but I still have hope that there is someone with some passion or just someone that simply want to earn money providing good stuff without all this nonsense. 

Yeah I'm angry and frustrated with Reforged because I started from World of Warcraft so I didn't played in w3 - after I heard about remaking I was so happy that finally I will play this great and famous game with today standards.

I didn't believe him A: Because it was 3rd Hand and B: Because I doubted someone at Blizzard would be so glib and leak something like that especially in the current atmosphere.

So I just passed it up as a coworker trying to sound cool and like he knew something we didn't.

But seeing this massive fuck-up from Blizzard, and the fact that literally EVERY. SINGLE. THING. this guy's son told him was wrong with the game was true plus even more....I could be a Reddit Upvote Superstar right now, but I let it go.

The guy named specific things too; the models, the cutscenes not being in the game, some of the exact bugs (like the immediate ""Defeat"" screen), literally exact stuff.

Maybe the only thing left interesting from what he said that hasn't come out from the game coming out was that apparently at Blizzard, Final Fantasy XIV has become as much of a dirty word around the office, at least among management apparently, as Destiny was for Bioware during Anthem's development. Apparently it's not in the same way as Destiny where they refuse to talk about it at all, but the son says the impression is that FFXIV has been slapping WoW WAY harder than Blizzard has been letting on and that management/corporate is upset that some reboot of a failed MMO has been able come back on them so hard and do as much as they have.","Honestly, the saddest part for me in all this; I missed my opportunity to farm some sweet, sweet Internet points because I didn't believe the rumors I'd heard in December about WC3",1,2020-02-02 02:16:54,2020-02-02,0.08477833867073059,0.07565349340438843

exlk8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/exlk8h/blizzard_declined_to_refund_wc3_reforged/,1580632513,1,"So, I was bored af and decided to give WC3R a chance(very big mistake, don't do it if you still hesitate). I had some money left in my bnet balance and I thought to myself: ""How bad could it be. I'll just run trough the campaign like the good old times, maybe play some TD after and have some fun."" 

WRONG !

When I logged in, the menu screen already gave me a hint of what I am going to experience, but the real ""fun"" was when I started the campaign. Shocked by the cheap graphics, unreal stuttering (on high end PC- 1080 ti, 16g ram, ryzen 7 1800x) and tutorial that you can't skip for 3yr olds I was thinking that it is a bad dream. How hard it is to create a smoothly running, good looking version of a game that was created 18 years ago in 2020? Obviously for blizzard it is very hard or they just don't care anymore.

Anyways, for the next few hours I've tried to fix my stuttering issues from various forums and fixes, but with no success. That was the point where I was done wasting my time on this s\*\*tshow. I demanded a refund stating that I haven't actually played the game - I was just trying to fix my stuttering issues.

It seems that I received a bot answer (assuming how many players demanded a refund it's possible)

I requested a refund for a game that I played only for couple of hours ( most of them even trying to fix stuttering issues) and I got declined with the reason of "" You have too much playtime on this game"". That is a shame for blizzard. The money I've spent on the game would have came back in my battle.net balance and I would have spend them on something else (like shadowlands, wow sub or D4), but now I will quit financing blizzard for good.

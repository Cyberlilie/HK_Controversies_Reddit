Not that their games have been great the last decade or so, even Overwatch is overrated., Yeah my sub is ensidig in a week, will not renew and let them know exactly why.

Usually not a smart move to piss of gamers around the globe., I'm reinstalling Apex as we speak., I already uninstalled all my Blizzard games before this even happened.  Considered reinstalling OW lately but I guess not, Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t Warframe count Hong Kong as a different  nation so at least there’s one game on our side, I probably wasn't going to renew my Classic subscription, but I certainly just gave a different reason for it that I originally intended when I cancelled. Fuck Blizzard; company is a money-grabbing shell of what it once was., Cancelled WoW sub, cancelled Warcraft Reforged preorder and won't even touch Hearthstone again. I had every card in the game too. I'll play MTG Arena instead or just read books for a hobby., ""Don't you guys have a country ?""

Blizzard, probably, Better off on private servers. And everyone said pirating blizzards product is bad. What does it represent now?, Try out Final Fantasy 14 if you're in the mood for an MMO game.

I haven't played it myself, but I heard great things about it's recent expansions., Im boycotting their shit since they cancelled pro HotS!! Fuck Blizzard!!, Come play and join /r/FFXIV

Trust me., I'd rather boycott both and give money to Lord Gaben (who would probably also bend like a little bitch to Xi)., Canceling my subscription today, Looks like Destiny 2 was the last thing I'll ever play on Battle.net, I did this not long after reading this. Fuck these greedy ass bitches. Seriously, it makes me so mad! Unsubscribing and writing this as a reason may not seem like much but if that is what I can do to bring this to their attention I will do it!, We need to crash the blizzard stock., I have a dilemma here, Overwatch is my life, I play ranked about 6 hours a day and have for the past two years. I'll definitely avoid spending any more money, but id have to find something else to fill those 6 hours if i stopped playing ow and I don't really like any other video games., I’m going to let my sub lapse and quit as well.  Shame, I was really enjoying classic.  Back to SWTOR with me., Classic sucks anyway.


Jk. I had fun for a month or so, but realized I didn't want to just keep doing the same dungeons and raids over and over again. Burn out is real., Already posted in 2 subs for WoW, but I'm canceling tonight. I'm going to use the time save from playing Classic to work out and study to get a better job., EA is still Activision, just like Blizzard. Still feeding the same company., Remember activision is apart of blizzard fuck both of them, Unsubscribed from wow retail, god damnit blizzard!, Come to Destiny 2. It’s never been better and free., Don't forget that blizzard is owned by Activision blizzard. Make sure to include them in your boycotts., Please don't play WoW classic. I have seen so many friends sink 400 hours into it, then whine about how pointless it was., Just another swinging by to say I've cancelled my wow sub, sickened to hear what blizz has done. I will no longer be supporting them. Good time to try Destiny., I'm definitely not playing overwatch anymore. Quit playing WoW a long time ago. Free Hong Kong!, ???, No you should not buy a EA game, because EA tournament has similar rule in their tournament. If you bring politics in a live tournament, you are banned as well. So please boycott all type of games. By the way, you may as well stop buying anything and start removing anything made in China at your home because they do not support hong kong.]"

Their talent has mainly left., Every game they have right now is an echo of it's former glory in the US., Either you play Wow for hours on end or never play wow

Hearthstone is a dime a dozen card game

Overwatch was fun until the newer seasons came along

Starcraft is meh at best (personal opinion)

Diablo 3 just a path of exile that holds your hand

HoTS was just an overwatch skin getting minigame that does less than LoL and Dota 2

Don't get me started with the side games and partnered games., How do we remove our account ? It says that email codes are not valid and i am forced to show them my identity card (which i'm not gonna do, they really take us for retards), They're video games, not heroin. Any adult should be able do withhold from a game in protest for a greater cause. Men and women have died for freedom. If I can't cancel my WoW subrciption for it then what kind of man does that make me?

Edit: spelling, I've been unintentionally boycotting Blizzard most of my adult life but now I just want to boycott them HARDER and I'm disappointed I have no where to go., Neither interested in Warcraft nor Starcraft and they ruined Diablo already, easy decision after the Diablo Mobile bullshit. But I also haven't brought ME3 after the Origin crap, which was my last EA straw at the time, nor do I buy any UPlay or Denuvo games (or other intrusive DRM methods that may come in the future)., There are enough games on the market in every genre Blizzard develops in that you will never be want for anything to play., I was this close to buying Vanilla

nope. fuck that shit.

NBA too, I'm done watching your games., What sweet games? LOL, I gave up sweet sweet Blizzard games a long time ago, mostly because they haven't made any in years., I'm not giving up Diablo: Immortal, I invested way to much to get one of those ""phone"" thingees., All their games have gone to shit.

FIAT owned 90% of Ferrari yet had no control for example.

Also people who say they invested 150 million have no idea how things work. If you invest into company you can't control it unless you are bigger stakeholder., >They also recently signed a massive NBA deal

They also recently refused to broadcast the NBA after they decided to not throw the owner under the bus., This is less about who is a stakeholder and more about access to the Chinese market., This isn’t why they made this decision. 5% isn’t significant enough. It’s because Blizzard makes a fuckton of money from the Chinese market, and they don’t want to do anything that will upset China and cause them to cut off one of their most massive sources of revenue, more like the fact that Chinese sponsors dump a metric fuck tonne of money into blizzard tournaments than tencent owning 5 percent.]"

Good Morning, 

I was just curious as to what happened to blizzard? How much money would we need to raise to get you off of China's funds? Banning a esports player for supporting Hong Kong is by far the most disgusting action this company has done and you guys partnered with Activision!! As a company you make a weak claim that you are protecting your image by attempting to silence this person, however in doing so you have proven your real opinion. Blizzard cares more about profit then about the freedom the people there are fighting for. Shame on this company. I know it's not much for one person to stop playing anything related to blizzard but I'll be doing so and encouraging my friends to do the same. Perhaps you have missed the video's of emergency services in tears because they are being physically blocked from assisting protesters, or the video of children as young as 10 being arrested. How about the videos of peaceful protesters being shot in the face with bags and losing their eyes? How much is their eye worth blizzard?  Maybe you've missed the news where they've banned masks in an attempt to arrest more people. Maybe you've missed the recent news that protesters have been shot with real ammunition now versus the bags. I'm glad you are in America where you can openly run your business with no issues of the government ever limiting your freedoms. I hope your office is nice and cozy while these people fight for their freedom. You've made your opinion clear blizzard. Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time.",1570537837.0,"[Blizzard is literally taking China’s side and not a neutral stance. If you read Blizzard Chinese post, apparently they literally say it’s to protect the pride of their country. At least that’s what the people who can translate are saying about it.

221,f30i4df,1,AnzuEnoshima,"Ok, being someone who has worked as a community manager for games, here is my input on Blizzard's situation as well as NBA's current situation

(Before I get started, I want to clarify that I am chinese, one that was born overseas and whilst I support basic human rights, freedom of speech and democracy, I however do not condone the violence displayed by protestors who are rebelling against authorities in an act of revenge towards police and political actions)

Everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion, political views and religious beliefs. HOWEVER! STANDARD TERMS OF SERVICE FOR ANY GAME AND HOST WILL OUTLINE THAT RADICAL VIEWS ARE AGAINST THE RULES!

You can express an opinion, but crossing the line and expressing his views the way he did is nothing short of an active attempt to promote propaganda, something no company would allow on a large or small scale behaviour, because it triggers conflict amongst the player base and a sort of drama that not everyone wishes to see.

If you do not agree to the terms of services, then do not sign and tick that box when registering for games. The moment you do, you are in a binding agreement with said company.

Blizzard enforced their own rules, there was nothing Blizzard has done wrong, the player was at fault for ignoring the basic terms of conditions and going out of his way to do what he did. It was an unprofessional behaviour.

Same with the NBA's situation, whilst they supported the managers opinion as his own, nor have they denied it to be wrong, that moment of unprofessionalism has cost the NBA their relationship with China.

At the end of the day, these companies, businesses and other nations arent going to interfere, dictate how China and Hong Kong should resolve the conflict.

Also, no one wants to be the trigger of World War 3, if things escalates any further, blood shall be spilled not to mention it is getting eerie that the events are get closer and closer to prophecies by Nostradamus and the Tui Bei Tu (I'm not superstitious, but I find it interesting that prophecies suggest the world war will be between NATO and China, bearing in mind 55 out of 60 Tui Bei Tu prophecy has been fulfilled)",1570554896.0,"[I think it is sad that claiming censorship and lack of freedom is wrong is a radical view.

I often wonder if their plan to take over more of the world culturally is forcing their restrictive government views on the rest of the world. What ends up happening is that these companies then placate to government censors outside their native country and subject the consumers to foreign censor boards. Wasn't there a shooter recently that had stuff patched out of it in the US due to China?]"

They didnt ban him because of his opinion, but rather because spreading his opinion as a professional player with thousands of people listening to him, is unprofessional behavior and does not belong in the esports scene? It is kind of harsh of them but as already said, Blizzard **as a company** protects their image. Professional esports players need to act as professionally as football players. Being a professional brings disadvantages too, one of these is disqualifying yourself from any controversial political debates, as it is considered unprofessional.",1570544576.0,"[I think you're semi-correct, but do you believe they would ban a player for speaking up in support of LGBTQ rights?, So all players of all sports aren’t allowed to talk about their political opinions? Get outta here, I agree with you. This was a post game interview, to talk about (I assume) the game. Hijacking an interview and using it to further your agenda (I'm not saying I disagree with the agenda) is wrong. 



If a football player, during a post game interview, started talking about legalizing marijuana or some more important political issue, they would get in trouble. Its ESPNs time for them to be all ""well we worked hard and we played hard"". 


On their own platform. Perfectly fine. I understand it's hard for individuals in Hong Kong to find a platform to talk about these things but maybe the bigger issue is that they don't know that we all know what is going on, and support them?


Lastly. The issue I DO have with this. Why did blizzard remove the interview? That doesn't seem necessary and does seem shady...., Paging Colin Kaepernick, I'm sorry but you misunderstand, Even though blizzard is within their rights to do this and we could possibly reasonably say that it makes sense for them. They are still on the wrong side of history and we should not support them., If their goal was to protect their image it's safe to say they made a colossal fuckup!]"

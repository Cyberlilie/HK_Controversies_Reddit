BOYCOTT TIKTOK.",7657,dgdwgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgdwgn/honestly_forget_the_nba_forget_blizzard_forget/,268,"I'm not saying that the NBA, Apple, and Blizzard don't deserve everything that has been said about them. They 100% do. And I'm not saying you should actually ""forget"" them.

*but*

I propose that we take all this energy we're using to shame them and aim it towards **TikTok.**

And if you use it, uninstall it.

TikTok is owned by a massive Chinese conglomerate called ""ByteDance,"" and **they censor content *not just in China,* but in the US and Europe as well,** based on Chinese censorship guidelines:

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing

>The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app.

And **they are staunch supporters of the CCP and operate with the goal of advancing the CCP agenda** (if not just directly run by the CCP):

>CEO Zhang Yiming issued a letter in 2018 stating that his company would ""further deepen cooperation"" with Communist Party of China authorities to promote their policies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok#National_security_concerns_in_the_US

And, **they are actively censoring the Hong Kong protest, globally.** It's the only social media site in the west where searching for #HongKong returns *no results.*

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/

Reddit is here destroying US companies for making concessions to China, which is totally fair. But, at the same time, we're all posting TikToks all over reddit, and it's a top 5 app on both Google Play and the App Store. There's a TikTok subreddit (/r/TikTokCringe/) with almost 200,000 subscribers.

I worry that we have forgotten who we're really trying to punish, here. Did Apple and Blizzard and the NBA fuck up? Yes. Do they deserve the heat? Yes. But damaging US companies to punish the CCP is a small hit. At worst, it actually *helps* the chinese economy if we boycott US companies.

Going after TikTok, who is deeply-entangled with the Chinese government (and lets be honest, probably just *is* the Chinese government) and is directly implementing China-style censorship around the globe is a much better move, IMO.

#BOYCOTT TIKTOK

EDIT: A lot of people are mentioning how they already don't use TikTok. I've never used it either. I suppose a better message than ""Boycott TikTok"" would be ""spread awareness of TikTok's global censorship and CCP agenda.""

**You can all feel free to copy/paste my above post in response to comments about TikTok across reddit.** I don't mind.",2019-10-11 21:38:59

Yesterday (20/10), riot police fired multiple tear-gas. Based on their reporter observation, they found the explosion sounds and smell of this kind of tear gas much stronger than the ones the police previously used. There's a chance they will release more toxic substances. 

Since June, riot police have been firing tear gas frequently. They have used over 5000 tear gas. However, since UK halts sale of teargas to Hong Kong amid police brutality claims, police bought tear gas that is made in China. 

According to SCMP, police tear gas supply cannot satisfy their demand hence recently they bought tear gas from China in bulk. Same type as the ones that the PLA counter-terrorism forces are using. They claim that this type of tear gas has a faster explosive time and more concentrated smoke, which will be harder for their target to make timely response. 

Professor Hui of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, CUHK quoted the research report released by the U.S. military in 2010, has pointed that if the tear gas explode at a temperature ranges between 275-300 degree Celcius, toxic substances such as cyanide can be released.

Apologies for formatting since im on cellphone.
If you know better subs to post this on go ahead
Business Hall of Bootlickers:

* Activision Blizzard: [banned player](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dexeva/blizzard_banned_and_took_player_off_air_after_his/) for supporting Hong Kong democracy protest. Confiscated all his winnings. Fired the 2 casters who interviewed him.

* Apple: [censors Taiwan flag emoji](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dex1j0/apple_bows_to_china_by_censoring_taiwan_flag_emoji/) in iOS in Hong Kong & Macau

* Apple (partial entry): [censored Hong Kong protest map](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-hk-protest-map/) from App Store. Relented after it turned into a PR mess, now letting the app into App Store. Update 
Apparently banned again (Im not on iOs so if a user can send proof id apreciate it.) [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfs4jw/apple_removes_policetracking_app_used_in_hong/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) it is. 

* Vans: [censors pro-HK democracy design](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dekxtu/vans_shoes_face_boycott_calls_after_company/) in its shoe design competition

* NBA (partial entry): [rebuked](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/nba-statement-english-chinese-66104687) Rockets manager for his ""*Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong*"" tweet, saying NBA was ""*extremely disappointed with Morey's inappropriate comment.*"" Backpedalled after this turned into a PR nightmare, now saying they support Morey's freedom of speech. UPDATE NBA is now in our good people list - they support free speech and China has completely banned NBA from broadcasting.

* Disney / ESPN: [forbids](https://deadspin.com/internal-memo-espn-forbids-discussion-of-chinese-polit-1838881032) any mention of Chinese politics when discussing Rockets manager's tweet supporting HK freedom. ESPN talking heads castigated Morey for sending the tweet & speculated about his sincerity, but they absolutely will not talk what caused the tweet: China's encroachment on HK and the resultant HK protest

* Viacom / Paramount: [censors Taiwan flag](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/tom-cruises-top-gun-jacket-shows-how-key-china-is-to-film-industry.html) from the jacket worn by Tom Cruise in the new ""Top Gun"" movie

* Disney / Marvel: [censored Tibetan monk](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/tibet-supporters-protest-marvel-s-dr-strange-over-changed-character-n677706) from ""Doctor Strange"" and turned him into a white woman. Per the movie's screenwriter: ""*if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he’s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that that’s bullshit*"". Now you can't even acknowledge that Tibet is a place lest our Chinese overlord be displeased.

* ASICS, Calvin Klein, Coach, Fresh, Givenchy, Pocari Sweat, Valentino, Versace, Swarovski: details [here](https://www.whatsonweibo.com/these-are-the-foreign-brands-apologizing-to-china-amid-hong-kong-tensions/)

* Nike: [removed](https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/10/08/nike-removes-all-houston-rockets-related-products-from-their-china-webstore/) all Houston Rockets related products from their China webstore after Rockets manager tweeted ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong""

* Activision Blizzard: [cut livestream](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfaz21/american_university_hearthstone_team_holds_up/) when American University team held up ""Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizzard"" in solidarity with the banned HK player.

* Apple: [handed over](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security) iCloud data and encryption keys to China

* Riot Games: [censors](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/dfcjqa/riot_games_owned_100_by_tencent_chinese/) the words ""Hong Kong"", forcing their casters to refer to the team ""Hong Kong Attitude"" as ""HKA"". Also canceled live interview with team ""Hong Kong Attitude"" and replaced it with prerecorded session to make sure they didn't say anything to support HK democracy. - UPDATE - Riot issued a statement in which they clear up this mess. They did not force the casters to have any special treatment regarding Hong Kong and namely the team in question. Seems like fake news were being spread. Worlds is back on!

* Cathay Pacific: [fired](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/cathay-pacific-denounced-for-firing-hong-kong-staff-on-china-orders) large number of employees for supporting HK democracy protests. Its flight attendants union head was fired for posting on Facebook in support of the protests

* Apple: [minimized](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20853393/apple-iphone-ios-exploits-statement-security-google-false-impressions) the seriousness of iOS exploits that enabled China to track Uyghurs, when over a million of them are already rounded up by China in concentration camps

* Google: [censored](https://lihkg.com/thread/1639291/page/1) pro-HK democracy game ""[The Revolution of Our Times](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=story.hk.hkmovement&hl=en_US)"" from Google Play because it was about a ""*sensitive event*"".

* Gap: [apologized to China](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/15/news/companies/gap-tshirt-map-of-china/index.html) for selling T-shirts IN CANADA that didn't include Taiwan & South China Sea islands as part of China

* Tiffany: [removed](https://news.yahoo.com/tiffany-removes-advert-over-hong-kong-controversy-093418861.html) tweet showing a model covering one eye after Chinese consumers accused it of supporting Hong Kong protesters & ""defaming"" China

* Marriott: [fired](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2128124/marriott-sacks-employee-who-liked-twitter-post-tibet-independence) employee who liked tweet from an Tibetan group

After decades of opening up wide the Western market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced tech transfers, and protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of Western businesses by China. Businesses that are not under outright Chinese control are still kowtowing to China out of sheer fear of China's retaliation.

This is just a very incomplete list of what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it really is behind closed doors.
